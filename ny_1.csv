The house was more spacious than any hotel in NYC that we’ve stayed in before and was perfect for our family and is great value. We loved the character of the house and neighbourhood and was a haven to return to for a cup of tea at the end of the day and she generously provided cakes for us. It was walkable to two subways and Emily provided great local info for food and activities. We were recommended Emily’s place to stay by friends who have also stayed with their family and am passing the recommendation on to friends and work colleagues.', ""I loved Emily + Jenny's place. They really go out of their way to make you feel like a resident of the UWS. From amenities to space and communication, everything was easy and comfortable."", 'Staying at Jennys and Emilys home was pure pleasure. The rooms are huge, the beds super comfy, everything is perfectly clean - there is even a little tea/coffee bar downstairs. The location is just perfect - within minutes you‘ll get to lines 1 and C plus we really enjoyed the neighborhood. When in NY again we will definitely come back. Thanks again Emily and Jenny for giving us a „home“ away from home.', 'This is a character property in the Upper West Side. Lovely accommodation, very spacious and comfortable.

We will absolutely stay here again!', 'We absolutely loved staying in this amazing historic house. Jenny was so welcoming and trusting with her beautiful home. She gifted us beautiful cakes as a wedding anniversary gift. The rooms were all so spacious and comfortable. There is bags of space in which to relax. The pile of soft and fluffy towels in the bathroom was very generous. There are no kitchen facilities available but plenty of water, a kettle, a Nespresso machine, a range of tea-bags and a little fridge, mugs and cups etc. With so many great eateries so close by we enjoyed eating breakfast out. Barney Greengrass is an old classic and just around the corner, and was one of our favourites along with Osteria Accademia just uptown on Amsterdam. We were really impressed by the recommendations Jenny had carefully compiled. The proximity to Central Park and the subway was brilliant. We’d either walk across the park or head downtown on the subway when we ventured further afield. The neighbourhood felt super safe and friendly.', 'We liked it very much, quiet central location.', 'We stayed at Emily’s house for a few days and it was just georgeous. Everything was perfect, it was very private. Emily’s daughter Jenny prepared many informations for us and she was always available in case you have any questions or need help. The house itself has a real character and is a typical N.Y. Brownstone. We felt very comfortable and definitely would like to come back. In the last couple of years we often booked via AirBnb our holiday homes and this one was one of the best stays we ever had. Thank you so much for your warm hospitality, Jenny!', 'Great place, great host! Very nice place and great location!', 'The brownstone is in a great location to museums, Central Park, public transportation, and different options for dining be it Mexican, Mediterranean, etc. or formal to casual. The building is on a quiet block for NYC and inside architecturally gives the flavor of how homes used to be built with high, vaulted ceilings, large windows, stylized woodwork and long hallways north to south optimizing the space the brownstone occupies. The comfortable bedding and soft towels were a plus. The host met us and took us around when we arrived. She also graciously left us a pastry breakfast our first morning there along with coffee, tea and hot and cold water from a dispenser. A real taste of NYC upper west side living!', 'It’s been one of the best places I have stayed when visiting New York.\nVery closed to Central Park, the train station, great restaurants, museums, and more…It can’t get any better! It’s a lovely cozy and historical house. Made me feel like I was actually at home! Emily and her family made me feel welcomed and were very attentive. I just loved everything about this place. I would definitely go back!', 'Excellent staying experienced! We checked in before Christmas, and the host put a lot of effort into decorating the home, including the Christmas tree and balloons. There are many great restaurants nearby and the location is perfect if you plan to visit the Central Park and Museums.', ""This place is everything one might be looking for for the neighborhood experience, with absolute comfort. You can walk to so many beautiful sights, and when you're tired, the host has made it a serene home for rest--with all day espresso, space to unwind. She thought of everything and then some. The home itself was a highlight of our trip. Thank you!!"", ""Jenny and Emily hosted very well. The facilities inside the house are also very antique and beautiful. Jenny always asked and checked if there was anything uncomfortable while we were staying in this house, which was very impressive. It was my first trip to New York and I think I spent it in a really nice house, so it's meaningful and I'll stay here again for the next chance! Thank you so much to them! And they are very good musicians. Also there is a cat in the house and it is really nice and cute."", 'We had a wonderful stay. Great neighbourhood and also great property and hosts.

Big plus for every Jazzmusic-fan :)', 'Fantastic stay in a wonderful brownstone in a great location minutes away from central park and within walking distance to most of the museums. Hosts couldn’t have been more helpful and we were spoilt with amazing pastries during our stay. Can’t recommend highly enough.', 'What an absolute delight. My wife, adult daughter, and I visited New York for a week, and we couldn’t have dreamed of a better location, a richer experience, or a more welcoming host. Jenny not only made sure we had everything we needed; she also has top-notch recommendations for dining, entertainment, off-the-beaten path sights, and getting around New York. The living space is ample, comfortable, and quiet. This is a beautiful home with a rich history, and hosts who are amazing and talented people. All the reviews are spot-on – just a great, great experience. We truly look forward to visiting again. Thank you!', '2 block walk in either direction to get subway. 2 block walk to restaurants and supermarkets. We enjoyed central park just 2 blocks away.

The apartment is in a perfect location close to Central Park. Clean and lovingly furnished. Highly recommended.', ""The traditional brown stone house on the Upper West Side is beautiful, comfortable and very authentic. We had all we needed for our party of three, with two bedrooms and a private bathroom. Jennifer (Emily's daughter) is a great host. She surprised us with some nice snacks and a good selection of coffee and tea. Being a local, she provided us with valuable information on local restaurants and best times to go for dinner. Since the central park is so near, we decided to go for a nice run through the park and around the reservoir multiple times. Great way to start the day and with stunning views on the skyline in the early morning sun. We highly recommend Emily/Jennifer and their listing and will be happy to come back."", 'Beautiful brownstone close to Central Park and a subway station. Enjoyed roaming the neighborhood. Very quiet and relaxing stay. Hosts were extremely prepared and kind.', 'Amazing air B&b. Would highly recommend staying here, great location and Emily the host was fantastic.', ""Emily and Jenny's home was one of\nthe highlights of our NYC trip! It was simply\nbeautiful.

The host was so friendly and treated us like friends that were there for a visit. There is plenty of privacy, and you basically have two floors of the house to yourself. Coming and going is easy and you can’t really hear the other people in the home at all.\nThere was a printout with all kinds of activity and restaurant recommendations and tips on getting around. The beds were comfy and everything was really clean. This is a really charming little brownstone! We would stay here again!', 'We stayed with 4 people (26J/ Germany) at Emily and Jenny\'s place.\nEven before we arrived, Jenny helped us find the best mode of transport for our arrival.\nArrived in the beautiful and well located residential area, we were warmly welcomed by Jenny and given a tour of the space.\nThe place is great, clean, and right on you, ""New York feeling.""\nTo the subway it is 4 minutes by foot.\nJenny was always available for questions or tips. We have used this offer and recommend this to other guests.\nHowever, if you are not interested in interacting with the host, this is not a problem.\nWe enjoyed the time in New York very much and we were always happy to return to the property.\nWe would definitely come back!', 'Perfect location for a real experience of Manhattan living while visiting New York. Exceptional property and very gracious, communicative hosts. Immaculately kept and a great neighbourhood. We had a very memorable family visit here and would highly recommend this as a place to stay. We hope to return soon.', ""Great location, very near to buses & subways for all directions. Felt safe walking at night as area quiet. Comfy rooms & beds. Great Shower. Jenny always quick to answer when messaged, didn't see much of her which was a shame as would have liked to have spoken more but we were out a great deal of the time anyway. Absolute bonus having the floor with table, seats and sofa to have breakfast and sit down once back in. One small negative very squeaky floorboards which can't be helped as to the age of them but you did feel conscious of the noise. Also had to ask to have the door in-between the rooms to be closed as we could not manage it ourselves so it stayed closed so did have to go via the corridor to see each other but again it's the age of the fixtures as all original which was a joy to live in for a week as the wood panelling is beautiful,"", ""emily and Jenny's home is well-deserved as a rare gem. For our first family trip in New York we couldn't of better dream! As a first step, we were hesitant to stay in our 12 nights at the hotel. So before the brownstone we had spent two nights at the hotel to enjoy the views from the East River on the skycrapers. Choosing to stay at Jenny's was the best decision we could make. Feeling at home in a typical house bordering Central Park is an amazing feeling. The house is beautiful. The two bedrooms (actually an entire floor with the bathroom) are splendid, impeccably clean and very comfortable. The entire 1st floor (tea room, breakfast room, fridge, coffee machine...) is available to guests, which gives the impression of having the house to yourself ( which is a little real). Unfortunately we didn't see much Jenny. She welcomed us with great kindness and immediately put us at ease (her discretion is remarkable). The area is nice with Central Park 150m away, nice restaurants (Bella Luna, good Italian, hearty and reasonable price level, the bodrum, very good Turkish...). There is also a whole food market 10 minutes to the north, good supermarket plan with lots of choices and the possibility of self-service composing your salad, hot dishes to pay for by weight (tjs more expensive than in France but real good plan to eat well, good and reasonable for the wallet). In fact, we can find this chain everywhere in the city, we can eat on site what we have bought in self-service, here no tip! To get back to Jenny's house: sit at the window of the team room and watch the street you will immediately be in an American film. Subway lines 1, C, B serve all of Manhattan and are a short walk away.\nOur only regret: not having spent more time at home (there is so much to do in NYC) as we loved living there. Our wish: to return one day. 🗽❤️"", 'Apartment as described, easy to reach by metro (several lines nearby) and less than 10 minutes from Central Park (close to the tank).\nThe beds are very cozy and the rooms nice. Jenny welcomed us with great kindness and was attentive.', 'Emily\'s place was a perfect combination of location, hospitality and efficiency. She is very thorough and helpful with ""insider"" tips on how to get the best a from a NYC vacation. Despite the fact it\'s a shared space we felt right at home at her place--just the right amount of privacy and host interaction. Thanks so much for having us!', 'Emily and her daughter, Jenny, made sure we had everything we needed from start to finish. They provided pastries and a variety of drinks for breakfast and were very helpful with suggestions and directions for the things we wanted to do. We loved the house, so historic and fascinating and quaint. Would definitely visit again.', 'It was a lovely well kept place. Beautiful and stylish with friendly hosts. Couldn’t have asked for anything better.', ""The host Jenny was very friendly and helpful in where we can go and see and how to get there. We also had some wonderful conversations with Jenny and Aldo on the theatre and arts and also shared what is going on in Sydney Australia and in NY. The accommodation and location is just as the photo's look and very comfortable. I would recommend them to everyone in Australia that is visiting NY. Lynn. Steve and I had the most wonderful time."", ""If you are heading towards Manhattan I really suggest you drop everything and book this apartment. We spent a week in the city, my 16 year old daughter and myself, and enjoyed every second with this Upper West Side Jewel serving as our home away from home. Jenny was the sweetest and if you are theater lovers, pls remember to check out the framed letters of thanks from Neil Simon, Mike Nichols and other stage/ film legends - to Jenny'd dad, a theater legend in his own right. We can't wait to book this place again. Just give a reason, we dare ya!"", 'This is a beautiful, historic brownstone on the Upper West Side. It is within walking distance of many great places to eat, the metro, and Central Park. Jenny and Emily really are wonderful, hospitable (super!) hosts. The house is full of charm and you have the second and third floors to roam around. After we checked in, Jenny showed us around our spaces and then we didn’t see them again. It was a great choice for a long weekend in NY.', 'Jenny, Aldo, and Taco were a great family.\nHer house everything was perfect! (location, rooms, restaurants)\nIf I visit New York again next time, I will definitely stat there again.\nMy daughter and me missed Taco(cat) a lot!', 'My family and I had a wonderful stay at Emily’s. She has a beautiful, comfortable home, and she goes out of her way to make sure that you have everything you need. Comfortable beds & bedding, super clean everywhere, and loads of space - a rarity for NYC!! The house is in a great location to subways, Central Park & restaurants. And we have a special love now for her amazing jumping, palindromic cat - Taco Cat.', 'This was a dream place to stay. So charming and our host thought of everything to make us comfortable. We all loved the charm, location and thoughtful details.', 'PERFECT! We were greeted upon arrival with a tour and easy to follow instructions for living in the beautiful and interesting space provided. The host indicated her open availability for questions or any needs should any arise. We fully enjoyed our stay…great neighborhood, easy access to transportation and good food. we look forward to our next visit.', ""Most charming place to stay, can't believe how lucky we were to find this. Emily was such a kind host giving us multiple tips on where to eat and what to see. A huge success wherever we went. It was a father with two sons trip (20y and 15y). Would come back anytime to this wonderful place."", ""I can't say enough great things about our stay with Emily and Jenny!\nIt was amazing to stay in such a gorgeous old brownstone on the Upper West Side and the inside was beautifully preserved and decorated.\nIt was spotless, very comfortable, and provided plenty of space for the four of us during our 5 day trip to NYC. In addition to the third floor, we felt very welcome in the second floor common space where there was a mini fridge and breakfast bar with espresso maker.\nThe location was excellent; very quiet and safe, within walking distance to many cafes and restaurants, and close to the subway and Central Park.\nJenny and her husband were a genuine pleasure to talk to and very knowledgeable about the area. Jenny also got us some delicious pastries from a local bakery the first day, which was such a thoughtful surprise!\nIt's no surprise that this Airbnb is so highly rated and I definitely would recommend it!"", 'I cannot recommend this apartment highly enough, it is absolutely wonderful and I can’t imagine a more special place to stay in New York. When my two friends Breda, Rosie and I started our search for a place to base ourselves during a 3 night stay in Manhattan we whittled the ‘maybes’ down to about 7 or 8 places, including apartments and a couple of hotels. Jenny and Emily responded to all our queries promptly and very informatively which supported us in making the decision to book their particular townhouse. All I can say is we definitely made the right decision and were so privileged to stay in a beautiful traditional brownstone townhouse, two blocks from both Central Park and the subway. Jenny was there to meet us on our arrival and was just so warm and lovely, telling us about the history of her beautifully-maintained characterful home, recommending restaurants, theatre and music events whilst inviting us to use the coffee maker, kettle, water cooler, toaster and fridge for the duration of our stay (provided in the foyer and sitting area at entry level to the property). The two bedrooms on the next floor up easily accommodated three separate sleepers in very comfortable beds fitted with quality bed linen and the separate shower/ toilet on the same floor was spotlessly-maintained and well-equipped with towels, a hairdryer etc. There are plenty of cupboards and closets available in both bedrooms and also hanging space in the entrance hall, adding to the home from home feel and reducing the inevitable clutter that arises from three 50-something year olds sharing a space! The property is an absolute haven of peace and tranquility in a stylish residential street of brownstone townhouses in the midst of Manhattan and the setting or the property itself could not be more perfect. The townhouse is within 5 minutes walk of wonderful restaurants including Kirsh for breakfast and pastries and Barney Greengrass for brunch, both on Amsterdam Avenue and Bela Luna on Columbus Avenue for dinner. Jenny took the time to chat to us before our yellow cab transfer to JFK and was so interesting and kind; we each feel her personality added to the magical experience of this trip. Thank you, Jenny and Emily, for making our trip so perfect in your exceptionally beautiful home.\nBreda, Rosie and Sinead\nStayed January 2020', 'Emily very friendly, who gives good practical explanations. Very good location 3 minutes from the metro, great markets and restaurants next to the house. No kitchen to make a meal but breakfast organized.\nI recommend it.', ""My family and I would all recommend this Airbnb. Great location for subway connections to other parts of Manhatten.\nThe house had a great feel. There were two stand out things on the mantlepiece.....you'll have to go there to find out what they are.\nJenny was great and helpful.\nNo negatives."", 'We had a fantastic time at Emily’s a lovely place to stay. Emily and Jenny super helpful and great to talk too.\nIt’s a five minute walk to the substation to downtown, liked the local restaurants as well.\nWould highly recommended it. We thought Taco the cat was a great little character.', ""Emily's place is in an area that feels safe and accessible to many local eateries. The Subway and Bus Lines are less than a 10 minute walk. The west side of Central Park is also a short walk away. The area is quiet and peaceful. The time we were there felt comfortable and though our host lived there, they remained out of sight, as if they weren't there. I recommend anyone planning a trip to Manhattan should stay here. The price is worth it, much better than a hotel, and more comfortable. Our host was exceptional."", 'What an outstanding and awesome place Emily and her daughterJenny have. The neighborhood is beautiful, and the house is -what can I say- enigmatic. Jenny and her husband Aldo were such great, respectful, and communicative hosts; we had a lot more than we expected (even delicious pastries) in the common area just for my family and me.\nEverything was clean and perfect in the rooms, bathroom, and living room. Speedy WiFi, AC, Fridge, toaster, and some food goodies were super handy in our stay.\nDefinitely, we will come back to keep exploring NYC!!\nThanks for being such amazing hosts. :)', ""Amélie and Jenny's place is the most special home we've stayed in yet. You can't even compare staying in a hotel. We actually lived in partnership with Jenny and her husband but full privacy. We had two whole floors to ourselves. In an authentic homemade New York atmosphere and with plenty of space we couldn't ask for more. Jenny was a wonderful host and took care of everything we asked for including laundry.\nThe location was absolutely- close to Central Park and 15 minutes by metro to the central areas. Cozy and quiet neighborhood but close to everywhere.\nWe will definitely come back here!"", 'If you are looking for a vintage style accommodation and super host near central park, look no further, this is the right place.', 'Jenny was wonderful! so accommodating and thoughtful.

She provided water, beverages, bakery, refrigerator & utensils. Top notch hospitality & hosting…thank you!', 'It is a wonderful place to experience New York City.

The beautiful townhouse, which is lovingly preserved in its original state, still sets the crown on the whole. 10/10', 'What an amazing week in the Upper West Side - amazing amount of space and having the breakfast/lounging areas were great for us, as we prefer to eat in a lot. But there were plenty of restaurants around the house if you wanted. Close to the buses and subways, but very walkable as a base for exploring. The hosts were lovely and Taco the cat was super friendly. We would definitely recommend and would stay here again if ever in NYC :)', 'Such a beautiful home, the woodwork, art, decor, it was a dream to get to stay in a historic brownstone home a short walk from Central Park. We had plenty of privacy and also enjoyed the interactions with the hosts and their cat Taco. This was a far superior stay over a hotel.', 'Great location and comfortable place. The host was very helpful and friendly. In a perfect world…the accommodations would include a small refrigerator, coffee maker and microwave 😊\nWe would definitely return! We had a great time!', 'Hosts were extremely responsive to questions and super friendly. Location was great for subway stop and area felt very safe. The house itself is beautifully decorated and full of character. Jenny’s local recommendations were spot on!', 'This house is beautiful, well kept and very comfortable. The two bedrooms were perfect to come back to and rest after a busy day of traipsing all over the city. Proximity to the park, the subway, and lots of great restaurants makes it such a great home base.

Very helpful and friendly hosts.', 'Nice place to stay at, it has all you need.', 'This was our first trip to NYC as a family and it was so nice to call this gorgeous brownstone “home” for a few days. It was perfect for our family of four. Our teenage boys shared one room with separate beds, and my wife and I were in the adjoining room.\nThe neighborhood was quiet and morning walks at Central Park (only 2 blocks away) were wonderful. The subway was very close as well, making it easy to travel to all of the lower Manhattan attractions.\nJenny and Aldo were gracious hosts!

It was wonderful to be in a space with such big, beautiful windows that also was nice and warm (we visited early March, so although fairly cool outside, it was delightfully warm and cozy inside with radiators). There was always fresh drinking water, tea, and good coffee available. Location was great - a 5 min walk to a major subway line. We could get wherever we wanted in the city on the subway, and it was nice to have a place with a neighborhoody feel to come back to as home-base. Jenny was a great host: flexible and a good, responsive communicator. She took time upon our arrival to answer all our questions and help us get settled. She clearly took care in ensuring we had a good stay. And we did! We were guests in her home, and there was mutual respect for/a good balance between communication and privacy."", 'Lovely and quite place with a great host. Close to Central Park and to metro.

The location really worked for us, it is in a quieter area, away from the hustle and bustle but has restaurants etc nearby. It is also really close to the subway and takes around 20-30 mins to most tourist attractions. Central park is also a short walk away.

This studio was great for that purpose. It has the basic commodities, the studio and the building are clean and well maintained, everything went smoothly. The area has a lot of things to do/eat, so it can be noisy, but that was not a problem for me. Different subway and buses at less than 10 min walking meant I could get to the main landmarks of Manhattan in max 30 min.

I felt safe and at peace here. As a woman traveling solo, I was very picky when choosing a place to stay, and the reasons I chose this location was not only the price and area, but its cleanliness, it is on the top floor, everyone knows each other in the building, you are in a private studio, the incredible hospitality provided by S&G because they had excellent reviews. Great shower, hot water, refrigerator to store food, they provided me with snacks and coffee during my stay (so thoughtful!), Robe and other items to make your stay memorable and pleasant.

Guillermo happened to be arriving home from a walk with Ramona the dog when I arrived, and he was very kind to carry my suitcase up the 4 flights. Thank you! Superhosts for sure!"", 'Super clean and a great location!', 'This was a little oasis in the East Village. I was very comfortable and enjoyed the tree view outside my window.

The room is small but very clean and comfortable. S&G prepared milk, coffee and tea and snacks and even a bottle of wine for my arrival. They left a sweet note to welcome me. I also run into them sometimes on the stairs and they are very friendly and always had nice chat with me. The location of the studio is also very good for me. I can walk to NYU and Union Square, subways are also nearby. The overall experience is very good and I look forward to coming back to S&G’s nice studio!', 'It has been wonderful to stay in the studio and I would highly recommend it.\nS & G are not only great hosts but also really nice and kind people.\nHopefully we will be back soon.', ""The Studio was the perfect launchpad to explore Lower Manhattan. You are in the heart of East Village with incredible restaurants and bars right at your fingertips. Washington Square and Union Square are a 15 minute walk. You are less than 10 minute walk to the subway that will take you anywhere you want around the city. You are less than 25 minutes to Penn Station.\nThe space is compact and cozy; for a single person who is just looking for a convenient, homey place to lay their head at night, the value is incredible.\nShala and Gui make efficient use of every square inch and added lots of small, thoughtful touches that show they care about their guets. The communication and check-in was also great. The neighbors were also friendly.\nOn small thing for any future guests: it gets a little loud on weekend nights.

And you absolutely cannot beat the location. Thank you so much!"", 'It was the perfect place to stay while visiting my daughter in the heart of East Village.

Perfect !!', 'Kenia was great and very responsive. The place had a beautiful view and the bus was a five minute walk that takes you right into New York City and comes often. The key to get into the lobby was a little difficult to open it kept getting stuck so definitely something they need to fix. Also keep in mind you have to park on the street and parking is limited so we parked and used public transportation because if you leave and come back in parking is difficult to find.

The appartement is lovely furnitured and clean. You immediately feel comfy, when you enter the apartment. The neighborhood feels quite safe. The view is marvellous. Unfortunately, the noise from the street was a problem for the one of us, who slept in the street-adjacent bedroom. For visiting Manhattan the public busses and the ferry are the best options. I would not recommend ride-services or cabs, as there are high charges for crossing the NY/NJ stateline and because of the toll for the Lincoln tunnel. We were a little bit irritated to read an instruction not to throw toilet-paper into the toilet. Kenia was a proactive and helpful host. Overall, the apartment is a good option for visiting New York if you are not especially noise-sensitive.', 'Highly recommended! The view from the window of Manhattan is great - like a viewpoint.

Keep in mind every time you travel into Port Authority Terminal (to get to Manhattan) it is a $4US bus ride on top of cost of subway in New York. Despite that additional cost it was a scenic ride into the city as you get a beautiful view of New York\'s Cityscape especially at night!

You can take it FROM New York though to the house.', ""All in all, it's a good place. The nearby restaurants are fine and the convenience store is close by, so it's convenient. The host is ready, so you can make it easy. The downside is that the Jihara windows are small, so it has a frustrating and humid feeling to it.

The private bathroom, which is accessible via a separate door, really helped us feel comfortable and at home during our one week in NYC. Wholefoods and the Lincoln Market are within walking distance which are two great supermarkets plus Starbucks is right by the subway station 125 St. The fast train stops at the station as well which meant it only took approx. 10-15 to get to Manhattan without having to stop too many times. It can feel a little intimidating walking the streets in the evening so we tried to be back before 10 pm when taking the subway. When leaving 125 St station we walked South down St Nicholas Ave past the police station and the Lincoln Supermarket. We felt reasonably safe taking this route. All in all we really enjoyed our stay.

The apartment is more run down than the photos would suggest. While there are no crumbs on the countertops, she will let hair collect on the floor and the garbage to pile up in the bathroom. There's also a thick layer of dust on the fan blades above your bed. The MAIN issue when I was there, however, was the use of the AC. I was there for two weeks during a national heatwave. Avg. temps were above 90 each day, and it was a constant battle to get her to turn it on, with her flat out refusing on the 80+ degree days.

The street is a little noisy in the summer time we were there, but you can get a good night's sleep. Personally, we don't like the Brooklyn neighborhood too much, but it was nice to have the experience there.

Quiet leafy street, that feels like real homes and community, more relaxed and human than Manhattan. Close to the subway - that area is a bit scruffier, but much like I'm used to in London. Great coffee shops and Peaches Hothouse was a superb Southern restaurant, like homecooked food. Went for a run and a yoga class nearby. People were so friendly and helpful.

As for the positives, we enjoyed the king size bed, private bathroom and location.\nHowever, there are a few negative points not to be overlooked: it is impossible to turn on heating or air conditioning, as it makes an appalling noise. Our neighbors (it's not the hotel's fault) were noisy… at 2:00 am…! It took another neighbor to scream in order to calm down.\nCleanliness was really limited. The heating is very dirty and the bathroom is not clean either (including the bathtub and the toilet...)\nAt the reception, we were well served: we were able to drop off our suitcases before check-in and the lady was friendly. On the other hand, beware of the gentleman, in the evening, who is very talkative (and will no longer remember you the next day...).\nFor check-out, we had to pay $10/suitcase to be able to walk before departure.\nAlso, remember to provide $100 security deposit and taxes that are not included (for 3 nights we paid about $85 USD)."", 'Very friendly staff', 'Great stay! For sure thinking about checking in again.', 'This was a perfect place for a long weekend in Manhattan. Friendly front desk staff and a nice hotel/apartment rental vibe with just enough space for 2 in a great location close to Times Square. The space heater was a life saver on the cold days and the heat lamp in the bathroom is fantastic! The motion sensor lights were highly sensitive, but we were able to create a little fort to block the one in the sleeping area!\nThe room and location were perfect for my needs and I would absolutely stay again.', 'Room is as expected, shower was nice had great water pressure and the location of the hotel was excellent', 'This was absolutely, without a doubt - the most horrible Airbnb I have ever stayed in. I want to laugh while writing this review, of all the ways this hotel could make a young woman traveling alone feel unsafe - and how much it absolutely sucked.\n1.) it was totally not clean. And by “not clean”… I mean, cigarette burned carpet - cracked sink - totally grimy and basically impossible to walk on without feeling gross.\n2.) it was either REALLY hot or REALLY cold in the room. There was little to no good temperature control, and I felt like I was suffocating. The window didn’t open, there was no fresh air.\n3. The sheets were uncomfortable. Itchy and scratchy. Thin. The comforter was insubstantial, and to add insult to injury, the bed was kind’ve stiff.\n4.) Coffee in the morning was absolutely not even coffee. You know that instant stuff that tastes sort’ve like horse piss that you drink when you’re on a camping trip? If you decide to stay here I’d suggest Bring YOUR own coffee because that crappy camping coffee it’s about 3 notches above what this hotel brews up in their toilet bowl in the morning.\n4. I was on the 12th floor. As a single woman. There was no security around at all. Also the smoke alarm in my room ... had WIRES STICKING OUT OF IT. It was not a working smoke alarm, and I’m pretty sure this is ILLEGAL according to any state law. To top it off the hallway smelled like frat boy vomit and cigarette smoke. I was also fearful that someone could break into my room at any time.\n5. Customer service / reception was pretty rude. Not the most rude people in the world - I wouldn’t want to work at this dump, either...but I would hardly call the attitude of the people at the front desk warm. After a five hour flight and a hell-ish journey through JFK, all I wanted was for the dude at the front desk to be kind - but was disappointed with his lack of warmth. There are way better places to stay.

Thank you!', 'Decent price for what appears to be a nice apartment. But you get what you pay for.\nThe room itself affords very little personal space. The room is cluttered with books, knick knacks, and seemingly random objects occupying every surface and shelf, meaning there’s very limited space for one’s own personal effects.\nThe bed is marked in the listing as a queen, but I am only 6’ and I had to sleep diagonally to fit without having to bend my legs. There’s also a metal pole that that protrudes just under the fabric right where your head should rest, which makes for an uncomfortable sleeping situation.\nThe desk setup is odd. Most of the space on the desk is occupied by the host’s own computer, and the expectation is that guests use that to work, using the guest login. I don’t know many people for whom this would be a feasible system, much less preferred - after a year+ of pandemic, anyone working remotely has their own laptop. This made for a cramped desk. The wifi router beneath the desk makes an extremely high pitched whirring sound, which requires one to wear headphones while working. Not a great working setup.\nThe lack of personal space continues when you exit the room, as the host’s own work desk is right outside. He is there working and taking calls during the day, and the walls are very thin, leaving little sense of privacy.\nThe common space is a cramped obstacle course. I tripped and cut my shin on the elevated dining console while getting water in the night. The fridge is 90% full with the hosts own stuff.\nThe host is very early to bed and early to rise (grinding coffee at 6am and in bed with lights out at 10pm). I came home late my second night staying here, and despite taking great care to make as little noise as possible (removing my shoes outside, going silently to the room then the bathroom, then immediately to bed), he confronted me the the next day claiming I woke him up, and was passive aggressive about my comings and goings the rest of my stay. I offered to buy him earplugs, but he declined.\nI changed my plans to end my stay early partly because I was uncomfortable with the communication style and incompatible schedules. When I attempted to update my reservation, free up the nights I was no longer staying and allow him to get another guest in, he messaged me in the app that I had “put him on the spot” and had created an uncomfortable situation for him.\nI found living up to the expectations of the host not to be worth the low cost of the room. I regret not getting my own place. I would recommend this AirBnB only to someone traveling on business whose intended hours match the early to bed, early to rise sleep schedule of the host. On the plus side, it is very cheap, and the neighborhood is lovely.', ""Thomas' apartment is just incredible - the architecture, the interior design and the location. I am amazed how Thomas optimized the space in a practical and beautiful way. The building also has an amazing rooftop with views of the city skyline.\nI felt really at home during my stay and appreciated the private room and the workplace.

Couldn’t have been better!', 'Upon entering Thomas’ place I immediately fell in love with the beautiful, eclectic interior design. Each room was styled with attention to detail featuring well-maintained plants.\nThe place was easy to get to via an elevator and there were local train stations within walking distance to get to all boroughs of NYC.\nFacilities included gym, laundromat, courtyard and a rooftop which provided stunning views of the Manhattan skyline.\nThomas was attentive to my needs and responsive. He only stayed 3 nights but was available to be contacted when he was away.\nThe main thing to be concerned about (depending on physical ability) is that the bed is in a loft about 3 metres (10 feet) high, and climbable using collapsible steps. This was not a deterrent for me but is the main thing to consider if you were less able-bodied.\nI grew such an emotional attachment to the place that it was hard to leave!

However, the bed is a steep staircase, which is a bit impractical, especially at night. You have to be quite fit, tall and careful.\nThis was the infrastructure and I think you can hardly imagine it from the pictures and description until you really see it. So far so fair.\nSince it is a loft, I often felt like host Tom was disturbed by my presence. Once he complained about cooking even though I had only used a little olive oil.\nOn the one hand, he wants you to keep ""quiet"" and be quiet from 10 pm to 8 am, on the other hand, it is not really desirable if you cook at home and when he came home after 10 pm, he slammed the door loudly and was also not exactly considerate.\nThe communication was rather uncomfortable, and it gave the impression that he doesn\'t like guests. I was ultimately happy to be able to leave', ""I had a great time staying at Thomas' beautifully designed loft. When I arrived Thomas greeted me with a warm welcome and led me through the apartment - it's just as advertised. Great location, Williamsburg, a hipster area with a quick connection to Manhattan.

But Thomas was also an excellent host: warm, always up for a chat and very accommodating.\nThe location was perfect too - there's a great array of nice food places around and it's also an easy subway ride into Manhattan.

The loft is the real Brooklyn experience that you see in movies. The bed located upstairs that can be accessed with the ladder is really comfy. The office which was available for myself was just perfect size and really private. The views from the rooftop of the building are really amazing and for me worked as an extension of the flat since I would grab dinner upstairs and watch the sun going down behind the manhattan skyline.

I appreciated that she wanted to vet me and my background/preferences/personality before approving my booking- it made me feel safe that privacy and respect was a two-way street. Since the moment I arrived, both Stella and Mike were superb in their duties at hosts, always going above and beyond expectations and making me feel like I was truly at home- whether that was making small talk, respecting my space, giving me neighborhood and transportation suggestions, and checking in when I was sick. Mike was also so friendly and such an ease to talk to! I truly appreciated his presence around the house. A huge plus for me was that the house, kitchen, room, and bathroom were sparkling clean!

AirTrain to Jamaica Station, then Long Island Rail Road to Penn Station, and then Uber to Dianna's in New Jersey. Was easily doable for two 55+ newbies to the USA, and was cheaper than full taxi or Uber from JFK. Dianna's place is within walking distance to the main bus route in Hoboken and it was easy and pain free to get the 126 bus into and back from the Port Authority Bus Terminus in New York. Just make sure you download the New Jersey Bus app first, and use that to buy your tickets online before the bus arrives (then show the online/app ticket to the driver). For those of you wanting accommodation in the greater NY area, we would recommend Hoboken - easy travel, cost, and great views of the NY skyline from the waterfront. Thoroughly recommend Dianna's place as a good place to stay."", 'Amazingly comfortable and walkable to a bunch of restaurants and shops. An easy walk to transportation over to NYC. Overall a fantastic, comfortable stay. The best part was the dog park across the road. We hope to be back!', 'Wow! I would definitely stay here again.

An amazing television, fully equipped kitchen, and lots of thoughtful extras and neat touches that elevated our stay to the next level (will leave the specifics to be pleasant surprises). If you're not familiar with the location, it's incredibly easy to get into Manhattan from here: by either ferry, bus to midtown, or subway to lower Manhattan. There's nothing like retreating from the hustle of the big apple at the end of the day and coming back to the relaxed vibe of Hoboken. There was also an affordable parking building nearby (by NY standards at least). Have already recommended to others and would definitely stay again in the future."", 'Wonderful 4 day stay.

I also met Dianna briefly and she was very kind!"", ""Diana's place is in a great location of Hoboken. It is accessible to the PATH train and bus stop and has lots of shops and restaurants nearby. Her studio is very well decorated, clean, and has nice amenities (easy access with an electronic door lock, shampoo, conditioner, robes, coffee). Diana is very responsive and helpful.\nMy only compliant was the sleeping situation. While I understand it is a studio and a futon is a common solution for these smaller spaces, it was 2 cushions together where the crack lined up to at our hips. My boyfriend and I were not able to sleep well during our stay as we found ourselves consistently falling into the crack. A simple mattress pad could easily remedy this if they did not want to change out the futon for a real bed. Other than that this is a wonderful place to stay!"", 'Thoughtful, quaint accommodations in a great neighborhood. Nicely decorated, well stocked, clean. Great location, easy check-in, and communicative host.', 'Had a great stay at Dianna’s place. It was just as advertised. Great neighborhood. Washington St is about 2 blocks away with many great bars/restaurants. We returned from New York via public transit and felt very safe walking the neighborhood at midnight (we were still on California time). The bus stop was a short walk away. There is a great family friendly park directly across the street where our 6 year old was able to meet some new friends to play with. The umbrellas were a nice touch - fortunately the weather cooperated with us despite the forecast and they were not needed. Thanks for everything!', 'Excelente place, exactly what we were expecting.', 'Great stay! Very good location close to the city!', 'Dianna’s place is located in Hoboken New Jersey which is a very cute town very close from New York City. With bus it’s about 30 minutes or so. Hoboken is a very cute town with yummy food! Connection to airport was also not too bad, it took us about an hour and a half. It was a very cute house as well, very cozy. Only complaint is that there is some sound that’s echo’s from neighbour/upstairs people so if you are a light sleeper I would reconsider, however I personally did not have an issue and with the location, price and how cozy and nice the house is I would still defiantly stay again!', 'This place was amazing a really stunning apartment!

The host was also very reactive to questions and proactively tipped us about an art & food festival nearby during our stay. We also took advantage of Dianna's tips for resto's nearby. The studio is within walking distance (10 to 15 minutes walk) of the path connection to Manhattan. At Pier-a-Park you have a very nice view of the city. There may be some noise on the street at times, but undoubtedly a lot quieter than in Manhattan, so nice to unwind in the evening. Highly recommended and we would definitely like to stay again."", ""The pictures of Diaana's studio online do not do justice when you see it in person. The attention to detail is superb and the place smells amazing. We knew it was supposed to rain the entire visit to NYC, yet we still forgot umbrellas, but to my surprise there were two umbrellas waiting for us at the door for our daily use. The location is perfect and there are so many places to choose from within walking distance, including a lovely restaurant/bar on the corner. The host were very attentive and accommodating making sure we knew how to get around Hoboken and NYC. I would definitely recommend Dianna's place and plan to return."", 'From booking, to check in, to check out, this was one of our favorite AirBNB’s.

We literally had 5 drivers show up and then refuse to take us. So if you need to make plans for transportation to either of the NYC airports, you would be better off calling a taxi or a car service.', 'Great place to stay in Hoboken!

The apartment was excellently put together and there was obviously a lot of thought put into being a good host. I still can’t figure out how they knew I had forgotten my toothbrush.

The location is perfect too, with the Path, grocery stores, the waterfront, and Washington Street all being just a ten minute walk or less away.

It was on a pretty quiet street, so no noise at night. Risha and her husband were friendly and engaging. We didn't spend much time there. We were, however, disappointed in the lack/quality of amenities. There were 3 coffee filters, no napkins, paper towels or tissues, no wash cloth and only 2 towels (which were pretty ragged). The bed had no top sheet. Risha did offer to get one at Ikea, but I figured it just easier to borrow one from our son. The dishes, coffee cups, glasses and silverware were sparse and quite a hodge podge. We did know there was only a tub (in the middle of the kitchen),but still would be so much nicer to have a real bathroom with a sink, counter and shower.

Red Hook is a relaxing and interesting area full of historical flair. You can quickly reach the water, find cozy parks and still feel the charm of a harbor area where half the world has arrived. The place has magic. Although it does not have a direct subway connection, you can get to Manhattan quickly and comfortably by ferry, the bus connection is also good and you will find many rental stations in Red Hook.

And if you do one museum or gallery, do The MET. Have fun in NYC.', 'Sigi and her daughters were very welcoming! Their two dogs are adorable.

Would have loved to drop bags inside front door before 16:00 (even if cleaning was still in progress) but wasn't allowed.\nGenerally, I prefer airbnbs where you can self check-in (e.g pickup the keys through a lockbox) and in this one it is essential to meet a person to let you in and give you a tour.
