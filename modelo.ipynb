The location, which was way up one of San Francisco’s many hills, was very peaceful, yet close to one of the nicest shopping streets in San Francisco, Noe Valley’s 24th Street.

To get to the city by bus, you have to walk the steep road steeply downhill for about 500 meters, for the way back there are bus stops above the property. Restaurants, food store etc. are about 15 minutes away on foot. All in all, a recommended address.',\n",
       " 'Christine’s listing was the perfect place for us to stay. It was close enough to get to many places in Sf, yet quiet and safe at the same time. The guest house was clean and had a wonderful view, thank you for accommodating us. ☺️',\n",
       " 'What a wonderful place to stay— immaculate, comfortable, beautifully furnished with a terrace and incredible view. Christine was flexible about our timing, responses within minutes, and created a space I can’t wait to return to.',\n",

Beautiful, restful, with an incredible view, the stay was fantastic and Christine and Jonathan were incredibly welcoming, accommodating and helpful. Christine went above and beyond to make the stay comfortable for our toddler, and we all had a fantastic time. We can’t wait to stay again!',\n",

       " 'We stayed at Christine’s two nights and had a great time.\\\\nPros:\\\\n- Great location, very easy to walk to lots of restaurants, cafes and cute shops.\\\\n- Excellent, prompt communication.\\\\n- Cute balcony with beautiful view of downtown SF.\\\\nCons:\\\\n- The apartment is on a relatively steep hill, so walking back is a bit of a workout.\\\\n- The bathroom and bedroom are on separate levels, separated by a spiral staircase. If, like me, you usually need to use the bathroom in the middle of the night, it can be a little stressful walking up and down the stairs in the dark.\\\\n- The apartment is a pretty long walk from BART, so we found it helpful to have a car. Street parking was super easy to find.',\n",
       " 'Modern, clean place with great views of San Francisco.\\\\nThe bus stops were only a few minutes walk away. By car we always found a parking space in the street.\\\\nIt was a bit unusual that there is a locked room door in the bedroom that leads to another apartment.\\\\nThe apartment has many seating options and it is practically a kitchen with large refrigerator.\\\\nWe can absolutely recommend the accommodation.',\n",
       " 'One of my favorite Airbnb’s — thank you so much!\\', \"This is a lovely place, perfect for me and my husband. We really enjoyed the balcony with city lights views. The neighbors are very nice and friendly, and this is a peaceful, quiet neighborhood. We walked to Noe Street area for coffee and some light grocery shopping (Whole Foods) for things that we needed. Uber drivers were plenty and close by whenever we needed. The couch is soooo comfortable! Nice, modern bathroom upstairs and a very cozy bedroom downstairs. Didn\\'t really use the kitchen - but it was well stocked and very clean.\", \\'This is a lovely, spotless and thoughtfully appointed apartment with a sweeping view of San Francisco. Christine was most responsive. The location is great—lots of restaurants and shops nearby. A great stay!!',\n",

       " 'We’ve stayed in several airbnbs in Noe Valley since our son lives there and this is by far the most comfortable and nicest one. From the spacious living area to the awesomely comfortable bed to the great view of downtown to the walkable Noe Valley coffee shops and restaurants, this place cannot be beat. It’s nice and private with easy parking. The hosts are super responsive and friendly. This is our new go to place in Noe Valley!!',\n",
       " 'Light-filled, airy, spacious apartment with beautiful views from all windows and from the private deck! Super quiet, Separate bedroom with very comfortable bed & excellent linens, living room, excellent table for dining OR working, kitchen well appointed. I was only there for a short stay but Christine’s apartment would be excellent for a longer stay for a working couple or solo traveler. Best neighborhood in San Francisco!! Hilly, lovely streets!! Christine super responsive and friendly.',\n",
       " 'Christine’s place was a gem in the Noe Valley neighborhood.\\\\nThe unit was private, quiet, and had a great view of downtown San Francisco. Christine’s unit felt spacious and was very clean.

       " 'I had a great stay at Christine’s place. Easy to find, available parking, and check-in was smooth. The space itself was nice, comfortable, and surprisingly spacious. Easy and clear communication with Christine. It is up quite a hill from restaurants and shops in Noe, so a bonus getting your exercise rings closed.',\n",
       " 'Great all around! Very helpful host who went above and beyond for us.',\n",
       " 'Christine’s Airbnb was the perfect place for our trip to San Francisco! The location is wonderful and the home worked perfectly for the first trip we took with our baby. Christine was incredibly helpful in advance and had a highchair, box of toys, and even a baby towel ready for us when we arrived. Will definitely be staying here for any future trips to San Francisco!',\n",

       " 'This was my best experience with Air B&B by leaps and bounds. The apartment is gorgeous with a little balcony and a terrific view, and Christine is such a wonderful host! I will try to stay there every time I go to San Francisco. This was an absolutely perfect experience!',\n",
       " 'Was great',\n",
       " 'This place was lovely, very well designed and arranged for the space! We live in the neighborhood and had family staying with us so it was basically just a crash pad for us at night but it was a great little getaway! The view from the balcony was gorgeous!',\n",
       " 'The lodging was great and met my expectations. I would stay here again.',\n",
       " 'The apt was a great weekend stay! It’s clean & roomy. The downstairs bedroom was quiet, w a cute spiral staircase that we carefully navigated at night since it’s narrow. I loved discovering Noe Valley & walked to restaurants & shops nearby. We walked to:\\\\nBrunch at NOVY ( yummy salmon cake Benedict & Greek food)\\\\nShops at Noe (clothes & gifts)\\\\nHike big staircases w views\\\\nLunch at the new dumpling place w delicious Asian food!\\\\nWe didn’t go to Firefly but it’s a favorite of many. It’s easy park in front of the house or within a block away. Remember to turn your wheel on the correct direction when parking on hilly SF streets. I find it an adventure to discover a new neighborhood & Christine’s apt was an amazing fun location! You can bike, drive or Uber to the Mission, Castro, and so many other nearby places. We drove to Union Square w its fancy stores then to Chinatown for dinner & walked to City Lights Bookstore. A popular beat hangout in the old days w 3 levels of books to explore.',\n",
       " 'Highly recommend! Location was perfect, great place to stay',\n",

The area was beautiful and super walkable. We already can’t wait to stay here again!\\', \"Lovely apartment, even better than the photos!\\\\nLocated in a quiet, safe area, just a short walk from 24th Street’s shops and eateries – the location was fantastic.\\\\nChristine was an excellent host from start to finish, very responsive!\\\\nNotes from our stay:\\\\n- Toilet upstairs, bedroom downstairs via a spiral staircase. The small night light was really helpful.\\\\n- COMFY SOFA.\\\\n- Fast, reliable WiFi.\\\\n- The small kitchen was well stocked with high-quality items.\\\\n- The balcony had a lovely view.\\\\n- It’s part of the main house, so we could hear movement from upstairs, sometimes a bit early for our liking.\\\\n- The internal door in the bedroom, leading to the owner\\'s office, made us uncomfortable. We wouldn’t have booked had we known this, as it felt strange having someone potentially on the other side.\\\\n- The heating worked quickly and efficiently.\\\\n- Loved the big TV with streaming services!\\\\nUnfortunately, due to the bedroom door situation, we wouldn’t return but still had a nice stay.\", \\'What a delight it was to stay in Christine’s Noe Valley guest suite. Modern conveniences within a charming SF neighborhood. Amazing views of the city and wonderful garden. Communication was easy/seamless. Would definitely stay again!\\', \"Christine\\'s place is lovely - with a nice little deck, a beautiful view, and very easy access. Everything was comfortable and clean, and the decor is very fresh and homey.\", \\'Christine’s place is as advertised: clean, bright, well-maintained, and beautiful. Plus, a wonderful view in a peaceful neighborhood. Exactly what I wanted.\\\\nChristine was a great host. Friendly and very easy to communicate with.\\\\nEarly on in my trip, I ran into a minor issue. Both her and Jonathan resolved things quickly and efficiently. Which I really appreciated. Excellent service.\\\\nAs for the location, it’s just a few blocks to the shops and restaurants of 24th Street. It was an easy walk that I enjoyed. And on a clear day, you can see all the way over to the East Bay.\\\\nIf you’re thinking about booking Christine’s place, please do it. You’ll be happy! 😎',\n",

We enjoyed the beautiful space, natural light, and great view. Everything was clean and comfortable. There was plenty of storage space, so we were able to unpack and settle in right away. It\\'s a peaceful neighborhood with easy access to shops and restaurants on 24th St. We walked down to Whole Foods to get a few groceries and really appreciated being able to prepare meals in the kitchen. Christine and Jonathan were wonderful hosts. Clear communication ahead of time, as well as during our stay, and the one time we encountered a minor issue, they responded right away and were able to resolve it within minutes. Hope to stay here again in the future!\", \\'Christine’s place was a little gem in Noe Valley. It was a well appointed and perfectly located for our activities in and around downtown.

The pictures don\\'t fully capture that there is an incredible view from the living room and kitchen of the city skyline in the distance - we spent so much time on the deck or by the window just looking out at all of the activity - the birds, the trees, the other houses, the skyline.\\\\nGreat location near Noe Valley. Highly recommend Firefly restaurant and Philz coffee, both of which are about 2 blocks away on 24th St. Firefly is one of our favorite restaurants in SF, which is part of how we chose this place.\\\\nPlace is well set up with everything you could need; great communication from Christine; easy on-street parking right outside unit.
