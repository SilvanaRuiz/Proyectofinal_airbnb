Walkable to the beach, restaurants and everything you need. The host was very quick to respond to my messages during my stay.

Review the mattress and pillows and bathroom.', 'Great hospitality! Fast responses, friendly, we felt right at home!', 'Not a good place that lived up to our expectations. Not clean. Bathroom is not like the listing. It was dirty. Bathroom sink was chipped and cabinet was old and dirty. Pieces of board missing. Walls were dirty. Mold in the bathroom. Not up to what we usually experience from Airbnb’s. Will not stay in the future.', 'We loved our stay at Dionisyy’s the location is perfect, everything you need is so close supermarket, restaurants, beach, the free tram.

Would go there again', 'The location is perfect, literally 1 block away from the beach, restaurants, stores and things to do! Dionissy wasn’t there but Maximo who welcomed us was friendly and was available for questions. The apartment is how it looks on the pictures, it has almost everything that you may need. The only thing that we would suggest to improve is the internet connection, it was extremely slow or not working at all sometimes, we had to use our mobile data plan almost every single day and when trying to do some work we had to use the mobile hotspot from our phones, so be careful if you need internet during your trip.\nThat said, I highly recommend the place if you want to be close to everything that south beach has to offer and we would gladly return to Dionissy’s apartment.\nThanks for welcoming us!', 'I would definitely come back!

They let us in early.', 'In general everything was great, excellent location and the host is always very attentive to us, consider that it is a shared, that is someone else lives there, but it is very nice, on the other hand the only thing I leave as a comment is that in the kitchen there were many bugs like cheap and also others came under the armchair, as is a little old the apartment I recommend fumigating before guests arrive. The place has air conditioning and also umbrella and chairs for the beach, the location is what is worth the most', '100 Recommended , place with incredible location, close to the beach a couple of blocks , minutes walking...', 'This is the perfect location for south beach, it’s got the beach and heaps of fun restaurants a 1 minute walk away.

I barely crossed paths with the roommate.\nThere is certainly a significant cockroach situation, which is no big surprise in a tropical climate, but I found myself afraid to put my food anywhere other than the fridge as I saw them on the kitchen counter every time I used it, and even a couple times in my bedroom. Also the kitchen is a little grimy, I had to pre-wash a lot of things that still had traces of food on them.\nThe internet is also slow, which is worth taking into consideration if you plan to do any work online or watch videos.\nThe bedroom and linens were clean and the hosts provided an abundance of towels as well as beach accessories (chairs, umbrella, etc.) which was much appreciated."", 'Thank you for this hospitality and availability, great accommodation very well decorated.

She went above and beyond by doing my laundry, and even offered to do it when I was extremely busy. As I’m busy, medical student nearing graduation, her support was incredibly comforting. I never encountered any issues, and I am confident that with her attitude, any problem would be swiftly resolved. The unit is small, with Twin bed occupies one person. Shower water temperature is hot, the fridge is clean, there is microwave. She even put candies ☺️. She works from home but she never bothers the host. She even offered me to help me move my stuff. She is highly respectful of your privacy and time and she even provided a preferred parking spot for my car. She collected my mails, never bothered me outside of regular hours. Never contacted me excessively like some landlords do. As a young female medical student under immense pressure my stay with her was incredibly comforting.', 'Very comfortable place .

The gift card to the host's restaurant and a waiting bottle of sparkling wine in the room made for a wonderful welcome.

I did not need a parking, but in case you need it, it’s not free as listed on their site, you will have pay extra for it. Another thing that could have been done differently is - if you need extra towels ( I stayed 6 nights ) , they will charge you extra. Also, for 6 nights stay I got only one roll of toilet paper! That’s something that is unacceptable. For more less the same price, I would rather in the future book directly the room at the Arya Hotel, where you have more benefits for the same price.\nPlus, the apartment is not soundproof, I had impression that im in the room with my neighbours that were not shouting, but had normal conversation in their own apartment.', ""loved the location as it's in the heart of the Grove. tons of choices of what ti do and where to go while still on the quieter side of the street.\nThe noise from the apartments/rooms next to us was prevalent most of the time.\nit's a great getaway to enjoy the Grove more than a restful place to relax.\nHost was responsive yet don't expect early check in or late checkouts available.

The room was comfortable. We really appreciated being able to access the gym, which is well-equipped. The gift card and wine Maida left were very generous, and we had a great lunch at the restaurant. We found the light from the hallway really bright at night because there are a few inches gap under the door, but gratefully the person in the room next to ours figured out you can close the extra door and turn off the light in the mini space between our rooms and the main hallway, and that made such a difference. I will mention for anyone sensitive to scents that the hotel this unit is in uses A LOT of scent all throughout the lobby and hallways. Thankfully Maida's unit is fresh and clean, but the scent does seep under the door.

Visit Green Street Cafe… we ate there several times and not once did they disappoint. Finally remembered that included gift card on our last day there. The only things that we didn’t like were out of our host hands, the elevators were slow with there being 4 available you would think this would not happen 🤷🏽\u200d♀️.

Please keep in mind that this was a studio but it fit two people comfortably. The only bad thing I have to say is the shower head was not it. Water went everywhere.

Very close to all the local restaurants and Miami beach.\nHowever the place was not clean. The first night I woke up to a cockroach right by my feet. They have roach traps under couch, sinks, closets ect. Upstairs neighbors were extremely loud as well.\nOur AC went out our second to last night stay. We were refunded for one night which was appreciated. But put in a different airbnb that did not feel as safe for 2 young women that were in and out to take on Miami night life.\nIf your looking for a small place to stay that’s close to everything and don’t mind it not being 100% clean then this place is great.', 'One of the nicest places we have stayed', 'Manuel’s place was a great place to stay whilst in Miami Beach.

Manuel was a communicative and flexible host.', 'I had a great stay not to far from everything and it’s so quaint and cute. It was perfect for my solo trip adventures. Would definitely book again.', ""This place is right in the middle of south beach and matches as advertised. The place was cozy, had a full kitchen, and a laundry outside. Manuel responded fast to any queries and was a perfect host (the one we never had to meet).\nHere are my suggestions for this apartment.\n* The AC never goes below 70 likely because it is still summer and temperatures are pretty high. This wasn't too bad during the day but at night, the bed doesn't receive enough cold air and can get pretty hot with two people in the bed. It would be nice to have an additional fan to circulate to the bed area.\n* As advertised, this place has a double bed which I overlooked, and it is a murphy bed which again I overlooked. I am 6 foot, 230+ lbs and with my wife, this wasn't a comfortable bed to sleep on. Again, this is a personal suggestion considering we were here for almost a week but if there was a comfortable queen bed in the apartment, this place would be a royal flush.\nOther than these, the dehumidifier collects enough water and needed to be emptied almost every day which was not a big deal (appreciated in fact!) but something to know.\nThis was a wonderful stay and with a comfortable queen bed and a fan, would love to stay here again!"", 'Great location and host! Manuel was very communicative and responsive to request. I’d stay at his place again on a future visit.', 'Manuel is awesome!', 'The location is perfect.

Thank you', 'Nice place , good location great host', 'Fernando was a very responsive host. We were unable to communicate with him since we got busy with our sightseeing at Everglades. But as soon as we were done and messaged him, he responded quickly and made sure we checked it quickly. He also went out of his way to grant our request, which is not in the description of the facilities. What kind of host will go further and make sure he makes his guests happy? Only Fernando! He made sure we are comfortable and well taken care of. Two thumps up! Next time I am in Miami I will book his place again. I highly recommend his place.', 'Convenient and easy stay.

We didn’t get a code, used the ‘contact host’ but no response. Got a partial text just before check-in time. I replied twice asking for the code, no response. VERY stressful not knowing if we would be able to get in. Upon arrival, we couldn’t believe this property got so many 5-stars. Cleanliness/neatness of the studio didn’t match the exterior property; no outside photos provided. Yard hadn’t been mowed in a month, cars parked everywhere, neighborhood not the best. No lockbox but we tried the door, it was unlocked and key was on the table. Key worked fine inside but was extremely hard to get into the lock/turn outside. Price, comfort and cleanliness were great, but we would probably not stay here again.', 'A true hidden gem. Very comfortable and the atmosphere made it feel like home. Found this while evacuating for Hurricane Milton, and Fernando’s place truly took the stress and anxiety away. Communication was excellent and friendly. He has had a good heart and soul completely understanding to our situation. Would recommend this hidden gem to anyone and look forward to it again under better circumstances of course. Not only an excellent host, but it felt like I was talking to an old friend.', ""Fernando was a fantastic host, was easy to reach if I needed anything and would recommend staying with him to anyone who's considering staying with him in the future!"", 'Excellent host, I would rent it again', 'Great host', 'Worth the money you pay for. Nice place.', 'The host was very kind, responded friendly and on time.\nThere are 3 doors, she gave us the middle one. The door on the right had 3 cars, and they used our space, we had no place to park.\nYou can hear a lot of noise from the other rooms, day and night.\nThere was glass on the floor next to the desk.', 'Great host and a nice/comfortable place.', 'The location was great and the price was incredible!

The host was exceptionally responsive and replied instantly to any questions! Be sure to try to give an accurate time of your arrival, as the host needs to physically meet you in the lobby to check you in.

We ended up being a couple of hours past our estimate, however, it seemed to be no issue at all for the host!

Max was extremely responsive on response and very helpful to provide places where i could park my vehicle for best price.

Everything from the countertops to bed to coffee table are of the highest calibre. It looks like something out of Conde Nast. At the same time, it feels super homey. Tons of natural light stream in. The balcony is such a gem. Having your morning coffee on a tranquil private patio surrounded by tropical plants was just so restorative (especially if you’re coming from a -20 snowy area as I was). Best of all, the unit is located in a nice tranquil oasis —away from the hustle and touristy bustle of South Beach. The host is a class act.

The apartment is luxe and in a cute, more private area, walkable to shops and restaurants around the neighborhood. It also is a prime location for biking, with CITI bike stations on almost every corner. You can bike to the beach in about 10-15 minutes. We also Ubered to the city and it was about 20 minutes depending on traffic, so super easy to navigate. Major shopping districts within 30 mins, such as Art District or Bal Harbour. TV's in both bedrooms and living room with a cute balcony. Really enjoyable tine."", ""Beautiful place.

It was wonderful to stay on a quiet and peaceful street to retreat to after going out in Miami. I enjoyed morning nespresso coffee on the balcony, and relaxing before bed in the soaking bathtub.

It is immaculately clean, beautifully, comfortably, and tastefully furnished, sunny and light filled, and best of all, located conveniently on Miami beach, close to everything (a pleasant 25 minute walk to the main drag on Ocean Drive; a short walk to the Lincoln Road mall; 5 minutes from great local restaurants and grocery stores). Despite being in the heart of things, the flat itself is located on a quiet, leafy, residential street, and every window in the apartment looks out on to a beautiful green vista of tropical trees and plants. The interior itself is also filled with sunlight, plants, and greenery of all sorts, all of which bestows a sense of incredible calm and serenity. We simply didn't want to leave! The beds are super comfortable; the sheets and linens are top class; and everything is as pictured. The balcony is gorgeous, perhaps the best feature of the apartment, and, in my opinion, in itself worth the price of the stay! I stayed here for five days as a newlywed, and we couldn't bear to leave! The landlord Erik is wonderfully kind, courteous and responsive, and very generous (he allowed us a very late check out on the last day because we had a late flight out, and didn't know what to do with our bags); he was also super helpful throughout, responding in detail to all our questions about where to eat/what to do etc). (I'd highly recommend you follow as many of his tips as you can, as he really knows the nice places). One word of caution: if you're planning to get a lot of work done in Miami make sure to bring an extension cord, as there are not many places to plug in laptops (there is a very nice desk on which I got some work done, but being unable to plug in my computer made things a bit awkward when it came to zoom meetings). But, all in all, this is just a wonderful flat, and the perfect place for a honeymoon!"", 'If you’re looking for a place that is close to South Beach walking distance, this is the pace for you.

There was a bit of a musty smell (which I will say is fairly common in these old Coral Gables homes if you have been in a few of them) but I think a larger air purifier/dehumidifier could help there. There were some things that should be taken care of/maintained a bit better. Personally, mold in the shower is one of my pet peeves so I would recommend the host clean out & re-caulk the shower. The bed frame around the mattress was clearly stained & very dirty, and the A/C unit desperately needed to be cleaned out (visible dust/dirt). Bed was not the most comfortable I have slept on, but it was ok for 2 nights. For the price, overall it was a decent deal.

Anything small I noticed that would come up that needed extra attention, Cory was responsive to and taking note of any of my feedback. The area is a great part of an up and coming area of Little Haiti, it was very peaceful in this space even on a semi main road. The shrubbery and entrance are situated, it felt private.

I truly was so sad leaving this space from how much I enjoyed it!', ""This is a good appartment for a few days or for a couple weeks.

The apartment is located in the 2nd floor and it's accessible by narrow stairs, which is somewhat inconvenient if you're dealing with heavy or lots of luggage.\n- The AC could work better.

Free parking for 2 cars, and having AC and W/D was wonderful.\nA community park is a few blocks away, Publix grocery is about a 6 minute uber ride or 30 minute walk. Liquor store, Walgreens, and gas stations are within a 5-15 minute walk from the house. Coral Gables is about 15 minutes from Lil Havana, a great place for excellent food and shopping. We were headed out to a cruise; the ride from the house to the pier was 20 minutes, but took 1.5 hours due to pier traffic at pier. The Miami airport is about 15 - 20 minutes.', 'Loved it!!!

I appreciated that she let us check out late. The general location was great for our visit to the University of Miami. The house was pretty clean, too. The only issue we had was that the house is directly on a street with a 40 mph speed limit and was quite loud day and night. Ear plugs/White noise is recommended. There are two homes on the property and some of the reviews are for the back property, which would be much quieter. I'd recommend making sure you know which house you're renting. I was originally sent the address to the back house not directly on the busy street and had looked it up to make sure we weren't on a busy street, but when we arrived we were put in the front house on the busy street. The photos are accurate but the location was not."", 'Definitely a strategic point in Miami, and in a beautiful and quiet place to relax.

Raquel was very kind to leave water bottles and little chocolates in the fridge as a welcome and it had all the basic necessities, even disposable plates and cups. There was no towel hanger or rack in the master bathroom, so we hung our towels in the door handle, no biggie, but the minor issue was a few outlets in the 2nd room didn't work, we had our toddler woth us and needed to plug a wipe warmer, so I had to plug it in the bathroom outlet instead.

The home itself worked really well for my son and I. My son is what brought us to Coral Gables as he’ll be starting UM this fall and had some incoming student events.\nMy only relatively small issue was that the home is located on a very busy road - a highway really. Which made it noisier than we preferred but also a bit challenging to enter/exit from.\nOtherwise we found the location very central with lots to see and do nearby.

The view was amazing, the people were kind and welcoming, and the hotel itself was just so exquisite. It was in the perfect spot to walk around to nearby restaurants and also have some peace and quiet. It was only a block away from the beach so we were able to go whenever we pleased and when we didn’t feel like it we would hop in the outdoor pool in the complex. We loved Fort Lauderdale, and can’t wait to come back and book this bnb again! Definitely recommend', 'Very affordable and pleasant beach hotel. We will be back for sure.', ""My cousin and I stayed here on a short relaxing trip. The property is exactly as described and in a GREAT area. Walking distance to the beach. It's located off of a strip with the beach on one side and many restaurants/little shops on the other. We loved the area. Also, a short Uber drive to Las Olas Boulevard! However, our first night in the unit wasn't great as our room appeared very clean but before bed, we noticed little, small bugs on the bed sheets/couch (not sure exactly what type). This obviously caused some distress. The hosts were very responsive and moved us to a different unit away from our original one and refunded that night's stay. The new unit appeared clean, bug-free, and we had no other issues. All I will reinforce is what everyone should already be doing whenever they stay someplace new--check your room/beds before settling. Overall, we enjoyed Fort Lauderdale and the hosts were very professional/responsive but this listing definitely lost some stars with the bugs."", 'Enjoyed my stay', 'I had a great stay for my birthday.

Overall the price and location ratio made a difference. The only problem I had, foreign to the apartment and of which At Mine did not comment and did not give me help either, it was with the staff of the cleaning of the complex. I was in the TV room of the complex, on a call for work and the cleaning person, while I was there I use a very harmful product for health, which made me very bad, causing me dizziness, nausea, pressure drop and I had to run out of that space of the complex because I felt so bad.

Looks just like the pictures so peaceful and private', 'This place is nice and location is great. However, be careful with which room you select from them and ensure you get what you select. They put me in the wrong room (smaller than what I paid for) and although they did reimburse me, it was not an ideal situation and took almost an entire day to solve the issue when I was only staying for 2 days. Some of the pictures are very deceiving. Pool is not as big as it appears and neither are the rooms. Also you can hear EVERY noise from the rooms next to you. I would hear clear conversations bc the walls are so thin, people in the bathroom, etc. I couldn’t believe how much I could hear. When I mentioned this to the host, they ignored it. It wasn’t relaxing because of these factors. I don’t normally complain but I feel it’s important for others booking this property to know the truth.', 'The location was perfect! 15-20 from everything and especially 2 steps from the beach. Very clean room! The host was always answering in less than 5 minutes. The only bemol with this accommodation is soundproofing. We have absolutely everything from the neighboring rooms.

Beds were comfy for some some and not for others. Communication was not very good. I rented 2 rooms and asked to have connecting rooms. I told they couldn't guarantee it but to check back with a day or two of checking in and they could see what they could do. Checked back every week and also 2 days before just to be called back the day before arrival telling me I reserved 2 different types of rooms and they couldn't accommodate me. Why didn't they tell me this when I asked the first 3 times I asked, even when I called?? Then I could have changed my rooms arounds... instead they didn't tell me until the day before but gave me the option to cancel a room and rebook, however I would not get a refund for my cancelled booking because of the cancellation policy and would have to pay full amount out of pocket for the new room.

It listed as two beds but the futon is not big enough to sleep an adult or be considered a bed. One of us had to get a seperate room because the bed second ""bed"" was just a mini chair thing. Also the shower door is very strange and only covers half the shower which makes for an uncomfortable draft in the shower rather than just having a shower curtain. At times the shower water would not get hot. Otherwise great communication, great location for the price, and checkin and checkout were super easy.

There is a broken glass hole in the window, that was covered with tape. The hole was twice bigger than the size of my hand.\nThe apartment gets hot and starts to smell even with AC, but the windows do not stay open to get fresh air in. We also had one of paintings fall on us while sleeping at night, it was not tightly secured. The wifi at times was not working, I was working remotely and that was a problem. We only had one set of towels the whole week.\nThe only good thing about this apartment was location, it was in a quiet area and close to beach but not facing pool. If thats all you are looking for then good deal otherwise would not stay here again.', 'Great location, for dining, bars food and alcohol. It would have been nice to have more than one shower towel each. The pool was not working our entire stay (4 days) this was not communicated to us. Only one beach chair and it was broken.

There was a pull out bed under the full size bed but it’s not able to be pulled out all the way. It was very clean! The entire building had a mold smell but that’s not Fabian’s fault, also the pool was dirty every time we went out to it, that’s is also not Fabian’s fault.

It was definitely coming from the bathroom & I couldn’t get that window open. I ended up opening the window in the main room & putting a fan to air out the smell and it took the smell away completely. Overall Host was responsive, location is beautiful with beach access.

First the pictures give it an illusion that is bigger than it actually is. You do not get a view of the pool. What is not photographed is that the window directly across the bed, gives a view of either a garage or part of the wall.\nThere is a yellow stain on the couch and the cabinets are rotting. Also the dead bolt on the inside of the front door is broken off.\nWhen I got there, the lock box didn’t open at first, but I thought I’d just drop my luggage and come back. The room had such a strong bad smell I couldn’t last long in there. I told Fabien immediately. 2hrs later he claims it was perfume. IT WAS NOT! I told him I couldn’t stay and left about 20mins after I got to the room. He kept saying he’s there to help but his concern was more about taking my money he didn’t want to cancel it. But the smell made me nauseous and not even an air freshener could eliminate it. I had to stay else where', 'Yes very good public review!', 'The Apartment given by Casa was good but there were some problems with the building.

Being able to walk out the backyard of the building, and right onto the ocean beach was wonderful!!! The building itself is decent, there was some infrequent noise, but I felt safe and slept well.

The beach was accessible via a door beyond the pool. The nearest bus stop was 7 min walk away. Great nightclubs within 10 mins of walking. The amenities were great. Very responsive host.

It was nice to be able to make some tea and coffee in the morning. Super fun time in South Beach!', 'This place was horrible. The only thing good about it was that it’s on the beach. Window glass was smashed. Very very tiny- can barely fit two. Bathroom so cramped almost can’t sit on the toilet. We couldn’t get in because directions were wildly confusing and unclear. We were grateful that someone else not related to our unit knew how to get in and walked us through the process. The lock was busted on the front door so it did not even work with the given key. Honestly- spend a little more and stay at one of the boutique hotels on ocean Ave. it’s not at all worth the 400+ spent. We left and went to another hotel that was gorgeous and saved our experience.', 'Very comfortable for a couple, nothing more is needed, it has all the comforts to coo.', 'The place is cozy.

There is no bathroom ventilation/fan, so you don't get any airflow or privacy there. The main room had a musty smell when we entered. The windows (one in bathroom and one in main room) don't stay open and need to be propped up. Host was responsive and let us check in early, which was really nice.

He got my wife a birthday cake. Even gave us choice of pillows.\n3- Ideal location. Floor to ceiling windows in both rooms and a balcony so you can watch sunrise and sunset over the water. 5 min walk to Coconut Grove's main drag with great restaurants, coffeeshops, etc.\nFeels like a cross between your personal apartment and a boutique hotel.\nMy wife and I were here for a week working remotely.

Cory is so thoughtful that you will feel at home no matter what ages are in your party. He was so kind to my parents. He helped them set up the TV and explained in careful detail how to use it. My Mom left an important notebook behind and he returned it. We stayed there with my one year old son. Cory provided a high chair and a basket of perfect, age appropriate toys. And if you’re not traveling with family, the apartment is chic, has amazing views, is comfortable and is walkable to tons of amazing restaurants and nightlife (which is why we lived in the area). We plan to make it our home away from home! Thank you so much, Cory! See you soon!', 'Cory was a wonderful host. The apartment was equipped with everything we could need and more.

I cooked almost every day, and remembered what it was like to have laundry machines in the home. The calmness of the unit and neighborhood transported me to a peaceful place amongst nature.\nHe has a welcome book that was detailed about other areas to visit and activities to do. Other than venturing out for a few meetings, I really didn't explore much out of this neighborhood.\nHis place was in the middle of the action, and tucked away.

Many amenities for family to stay entertained. Cory was great communicating throughout the process. We will be back!', 'Excellent AirB&B! Basically everything in the condo was brand new and everything was also well thought out. The mattress is phenomenal, which is very rare when vacationing. Cory thought of every single detail. Literally. From stationary to toiletries, and kitchen essentials. There was literally everything you would need in the condo. Even books, games and phone chargers. The condo is well decorated and thoughtful (I loved the lamps in the bedroom with built in low light / night light if needed). As well as true Black out curtains for any light that you may not want seeping in. As another reviewer said we also sat on the balcony and watched the iguanas in the morning soaking up the sun on the tops of the trees. The location is perfection! Everything is within walking distance. Shops, restaurants, parks and the brand new luxury cinema in cocowalk. We only drive once, and that was to the grocery store once we arrived. I cannot thank Cory enough for his excellent communication and thoughtfulness. Will definitely be back (if we can get in! I see it’s already booking up)!', 'Cory’s place was really nice and clean.

You are an outstanding person.', 'We stayed in this condo for 3 weeks, and it was a very quiet, peaceful experience. The place was perfect. We were able to cook small meals in the kitchen. They have pots, bowls, plates utensils, everything you need. We were also surrounded by great restaurants when we decided to go out. The hotel was very quiet, we were able to lounge by the pool everyday. It was not busy or overcrowded at all. We will definitely be staying here when we are back in Miami.', 'Fantastic stay! Almost reluctant to put how great this place is because I want to keep it a secret just for me!\nBut, lovely views, stylish decor, perfect amenities, close to restaurants, parks and the marina and Cory thought of all the little details a guest would want.

Just book it!', 'We thoroughly enjoyed staying at Cory’s, will book again if we are in town!', ""A wonderful Airbnb experience with Cory. The place is like a hybrid since it's situated in a hotel, so you have the amenities with a pool/gym, plus personal touches from Cory. The space was super comfortable, clean, and in a convenient location of Coconut Grove.

The location is perfect--just a few minutes walk from the center of Coconut Grove with all its shops and restaurants. What really puts this apartment over the top, though, is its host, Cory, who attends to every little detail for a perfect vacation. He sends a questionnaire before you arrive to allow him to personalize your stay. (Have children? He can provide toys!). He's there to meet you and answer any questions about the apartment when you arrive. There are all sorts of thoughtful little touches--a mojito recipe with all the ingredients and tools to prepare it to welcome you, fruit and pastries for your first breakfast, a variety of snacks, and a very extensive collection of every kind of toiletry you could possibly need. We couldn't recommend this more highly, and are already checking Cory's availability calendar to schedule another visit."", 'My husband and I had a wonderful week-long stay at Corey\'s place in Coconut Grove.

The convenient parking meant we could drive to explore more of the city. APARTMENT: The apartment itself is lovely, just as pictured. Nice views of the water, the marina, and the park. The shower is a delight. The building has a small gym and a nice pool/hot tub too. HOSTS: Luis who checked us in was flexible on timing and friendly and Corey checked in on us.

We will definitely stay here again.', 'Barbara and Ron by far are the greatest hosts we have come across. My husband and I was in Miami to celebrate his birthday and our 5th wedding anniversary. They were very welcoming and surprised us with a beautiful cake and some champagne. Their cottage was clean, very organized, and very detailed. They also gave us amazing tips while visiting with them. If I could give 10 stars I would, they also offered us a late check out, and very military friendly. Sweet Dreams Lakeside Cottage is definitely a place we would revisit.', ""Barbara and Ron were great hosts. They were super friendly and went above and beyond to make our stay great! I read a review before booking that Barbara thought of everything and that is truly the case.

I'd definitely stay with them again!"", 'Barbra and her husband were very welcoming and if we ever needed anything at any time she was just a call away. They have a lovely itinerary book with a lot of great recommendations for beaches, restaurants, views, etc. and everything she recommended to do was in a 5-10 mile radius. I would highly recommend staying here if you’re in the area!', 'Barb & Rons place pretty much checks everything off or the perfect airbnb experience. 100% would definitely stay there again! You can expect a super clean room, fully stocked kitchen where you can cook an entire meal including spices... pretty much the entire place has anything you could possibly need. The back yard though, its way better than the photos.... absolutely breath-taking.

The location was excellent right at the beach front."", 'Great place in an awesome location, beach access is amazing!', ""Location is the greatest thing about this place. Beach is a just a 3 minute walk out the back door. In a quiter neighborhood, felt safe walking around at night and saw lots of families in the area. Close enough to walk to clubs. The key fob was having issues, we would have to walk around the front of the building everytime we got back from beach due to not being able to open the side entrance without anything other than the fob. Room was as pictured, but there was a strong odor that kinda smelled like ammonia. Im not sure if it was something they cleaned with before we arrived, but it was very pungent and hard to get used to. AC did not work very great, especially in the bedroom. We ended up sleeping in living room because it was a bit cooler. Beach chair service was provided which was nice. Shower made no sense, very easy to get bathroom soaking wet because of where the half door was placed. Probably would not stay here again. 3 star motel vibes, you're honestly paying for location."", 'I highly recommend this place for an amazing stay in South Beach.\nIt is close to the beach with many restaurants nearby.\nWater in the pool was a bit cold, but I enjoyed my swimm.\nThe apartment was very clean!', 'We absolutely loved staying at Suzi’s beach condo!

Maybe the light bulb needed to be changed.', ""I've been doing AirBB for about 5 years now, and Suzi's place was by far the best one that I've stayed at. Everything was super clean.

Suzi was very clear with her instructions and provides pictures so there’s no room for any confusion which is really liked. Room was super clean and spotless. Keep in mind there’s no free parking only street parking you have to pay for. i paid a total of $100+ alone just for parking for a 2 night 3 day stay and parking isn’t guaranteed, one night we had to park 5 blocks away because of how busy ocean drive was so keep that in mind. If you plan on just staying on ocean drive and not driving out of the area then it’s amazing you’ll enjoy but if you are going out i’d honestly uber or ride the bus because finding parking was stressful.', 'This is my third stay here.

The pool area was small, but also kept very clean and was private. The apartment is easy to access and right near the beach access door. Although there is no stove, a hot plate is provided which easily allowed us to cook hot breakfasts and simple dinners. You will need to plan to bring all of your own condiments and such. Parking is a challenge as it is either street parking or a nearby lot, and is expensive ($40/day). Suzi was very helpful in providing us tips for parking and grocery stores/markets in the area. We would definitely return!"", 'Suzi is a great host and her place is always the best place to stay. She has everything you need. Suzi responds fast and is accommodating.

Slightly south from the busiest areas, which is great, and walkable to the best spots. I was there with my wife and two toddlers.', 'My bf and I had a great stay at the apt!

The apartment itself is very bright with lights coming in, SUPER CLEAN!!, extra towels, water pressure is good in shower, kitchen is stocked with necessary pots & pans, good coffee maker (2 machines!) & everyday condiments that one can cook if you want to. Perfect for a couple but Suzi has an extra air mattress & portable crib for extra adult or child. Having lounge chairs & umbrella at the beach is a big bonus.\nI am definitely recommending this place & will come back again.', 'Nice place in a fantastic location. Suzi was very accommodating and a great host.', 'Solid space in a great location with everything you need! My partner and I spent 3 nights at Suzi’s place and had zero complaints. The space was good for two people, and the beach access and complimentary chairs were the cherry on top. The actual apartment is on the ground floor, but has nice curtains that give you privacy. The bonus of being on the 1st floor is that you are maybe 500 ft from the pool/beach access. If you want to venture from the beach you can walk to many bars and restaurants and even some shopping. Overall the space was quiet, no outdoor or neighbor noise, and despite the bed is a bit squishy for us we slept great. Equipped with a smart TV (and okay WiFi)', 'Great Location', 'What\'s not to like? Right on Ocean Drive with access to the beach.

Suzi is great: responsive, helpful, and really has the apartment stocked well with coolers, beach toys, beach towels, extra linens, blankets, a crib if you need it, etc. And having use of beach chairs/umbrella was great.

The pool area was much nicer in-person than the photos.\nWhile there is no view from the rental and the cost was a bit high (over $450 a night with taxes and fees) for our three night stay, we would stay here again.

There’s even a Starbucks that’s a 3 minute walk for your am coffee fix. You don’t even feel the need to rent a car because of the convenient location. Suzi is a wonderful host who gave great suggestions and answered any questions we had throughout our stay. She has equipped the Airbnb with anything you may need for the beach (coolers, toys, beach towels). A seriously cool perk is the two beach chairs and umbrella included with your stay. The beach chairs are very supportive and have a pad on top for lots of comfort. It just made the days spent at the beach all the more enjoyable! There is also a bike/walking path the runs right behind the complex that spans all of Miami Beach coast.

The neighborhood felt very safe and the apartment welcoming. The second bedroom is open to the living room with sliding panels to create a cozy enclosed space for sleeping. Loved the black out curtains in this room. The other bedroom is a larger and more private room with an en suite bathroom.

We were extremely patient yet the host took a while to respond. On top of that, the elevator stopped working and had to carry our heavy luggage up the stairs. Once in the room, the strong smell of bleach was absolutely awful. We had to open the windows and air out the room.

They let us know that the staff wouldn’t be there by the time we planned to get back so they gave us a code to be able to grab our luggage that they had locked away for us.

During our stay, the elevator was out-of-service, but walking up the stairs wasn’t bad at all.

The elevator didn’t work and we weren’t told until a day before our trip so we had to walk the stairway the entire time.', 'Very nice', ""Location was great as it was close to the beach and place was decently clean. The bed sheets had yellow stains and the floor didn't look like it was mopped. The water took a while to get hot so I suggest letting it run until it gets to temperature of desire. The elevator does not work which was a huge inconvenience if you were in the upper floors. Apparently they are waiting for a part. The stairway smelled terrible and having to walk up/down 4 flights was not pleasant. If you need help with luggage up/down the stairs there's only someone available between 9am-11am and sometimes they will be on call depending on the time. Overall, it was okay but that broken elevator was a deal breaker for us. Please consider this if you decide to stay here."", 'The place is very small.

Good for 1-2 nights. Nothing more than that in my opinion', 'Everything was pretty good.', 'We had a very responsive and friendly host/front desk. They did warn us before arrival about the elevator being broken, so we did have to use the stairs.

All questions and reservations that I had were quickly answered, which was awesome! I will however say that it did lack in some areas. Upon arrival you can see that the facility is super dressed up, but if you look behind all of that you will see TONS of filth. The room we stayed in was somewhat clean BUT there were a few times I questioned if the room was deeply cleaned like it should’ve been. Upon arrival there were fake eyelashes on the ground, hair/stains on the bed, and trash in the trashcan. The whole apartment complex smelt straight like mildew, so that was also something that made me feel like it was dirty. Regardless, the price offered for a day stay was unbeatable and I now see why. If I went back I’d probably stay somewhere a little more expensive just to feel a sense of comfort but if you’re on a budget it’s not a bad option, just beware of these things!!!', 'Good price', 'The host was very responsive.

Bathroom fine, tiny little kitchenette. The only thing was that the elevator was not working and we were on the 6th floor. But eh whatever it was fine, It was close to the beach. Parking is not great and more or less you need to park in a parking garage at $40 per night, otherwise park much further away. I highly recommend brining an electric scooter which you can drop in your trunk. Then you can a) park further away and b) can use the scooter for places instead of having to move your car. During the day there is paid street parking using ParkMobile app which usually can be found (except in the popular spots, which is again where you use the scooter so you can park further away). And definitely go to eat on Espanola Way.', 'Great for a weekend. Definitely I will take it in the future', 'Amazing amazing place to stay.

It was easy getting inside the Airbnb/hotel and easy directions to get inside the unit. The breach is a short .5 block away. It was a perfect place for the beach and to just relax. No loud noise or music. The unit is small but also fine. We could fit a whole bag of ice in the freezer and lots of left over food in the fridge. Also, they did supply small little toiletries for the bathroom, but we did not use any of them because we had our own stuff. The sheets and towels were clean. No bad smells anywhere. Our window faced the opposite direction of the beach but the view was still nice. We had a rental and parked right outside every night. The parking tenants are watching the meters but that’s not the Airbnb’s problem. A CVS and small bars and restaurants are also walking distance,\nWe will stay again in the future. Perfect for the price and location. Glad we stayed', 'Great location !!', 'Place is very close to the beach, and picture is exactly as described.

Likewise, I think that because it is an interior apartment adjacent to the same house, the issue of isolation is not the best and the noises are a little (I imagine that of both places) and smells.\nThe location although it's good, we had to incur a lot of Uber spending because there weren't many micro tours around the place and getting there from the subway at night was a bit dangerous.\nNonetheless it is a nice and cute place.\nAnd Kelly is always attentive to responses."", 'Great accommodations for the price.

If you want to cook there's a full kitchen with everything you need ,even a blender so you can make fresh smoothies in the morning.

The room and bathroom were squeaky clean. We almost booked at the 1 Hotel but so glad we stayed here instead because: it is more private/chill making us feel at home, less ‘people-y’ in the lobby for when you don’t want to dress up, the room has a full kitchen, and because of the great price with all the 1 Hotel access we needed. Whenever we wanted a more social experience, we simply popped on over to the 1 Hotel. Best of both worlds!\nThis room/condo is in the Roney Palace. It has a private and very nice entrance. The lobby smells SO good. The Roney Palace and the 1 Hotel are connected on the lowest floor for convenient access (ask front security how to get there or anywhere, they are so helpful).

Edwardo was wonderful.', 'It’s a great place to stay, both the apartment itself and its location in Wynwood. The place was exactly as described and functioned well! It’s a good value for the area as well, even when compared to hotels. One tip is that there is no place to park your car until you’ve checked in. You have to find some street parking, or use a valet next door. After check in, you can then move your car from the street/valet to the parking garage for the apartment. Also noteworthy is that you must park in the 3rd floor spot #73. If you show up tired (like I did), you might accidentally park in spot #73 on the second floor (which later caused me some key card errors the front desk had to resolve). I was totally satisfied with the rental, and would absolutely rent this apartment again!', 'Great location! Clean apartment with everything needed.

The first night didn't stop ringing and you could hear it until the room. The second night we didn't have that problem anymore but if it sounded for a while in each Ida in the bathroom.

Ivan was not aware of this, but it was vox populi throughout the building that the air didn't work a week ago. Everything was cumbersome and wasted time. Ivan partially returned the money to me and I was unaware that I had paid to leave later. Which is obviously the chats with him and he is registered with Airbnb. I end up threatening me that if I didn't leave at 10, I was going with the security of the building. I spent two horrible days in Miami from my expected vacation by a scammer and bully.

We had never been to this part of Florida before and our stay with Leonard gave an amazing first impression. We would highly recommend Leonard's place and would 100% stay here again.

The location is 10/10. You can walk to a lot of places and the Ubers are really cheap. I wouldn’t recommend renting a car cause there’s no parking and the valet parking is 42 us daily. The bed is super comfortable, the stove is easy to use and it even has a dishwasher and laundry closet, everything you need. Sadly we weren’t able to use the amazing amenities described due to an electrical problem the building had, but they made a deal with the Marquis hotel and they let us use their gym. On our first day the elevator was out of use for more than 5 hours and some staff at the complex were really rude to all the people trying to get to their floor. This is the only reason why I’m not rating this place 5/5. But the hosts, the apartment and the location are 10/10.', 'Amazing location, clean and beautiful', 'excellent location close to everything', 'Great property!', 'Absolutely loved the place.

The one and only set back is the parking is valet only and expensive so brace yourself for that. We were allowed to check in late and were charged a $50 fee for doing so but it was understandable because it was late and we knew the reservation was not a self check in booking.

After getting in the room I checked to make sure I did pay for the drinks and turns out I DID.

Cute 1 bedroom place in little Havana. Great to lay your head, chill in the air condition and watch Netflix, Hulu, Amazon plus, YouTube etc… one thing I’d say is that If you are going to order food to be delivered, I’d suggest putting the address of one of the businesses close by and meet the driver outside of the gate so that it is easier for them to find you.

The apartment is comfortable and stocked with things you can use.\nThe host was very kind. She let me leave my suitcase at the airbnb after checkout so I didn’t have to carry it around before my flight. There was a problem with the AC leaking and she fixed it right away. When I told her I liked dancing she searched for some places and sent me some recomendaciones. I appreciate her taking the time to do that and making sure I had a nice stay.\nWhile she was very nice, the host messaged me constantly both before I checked in and during my stay. Like constantly. She sent the entire handbook (which is on airbnb) in the chat (I think twice), sent me the wifi information at least 5 times (without my asking for it because it’s on the app), laundry info twice (again on the app already and I didn’t need to do laundry), warned me twice that daylight savings time exists (of course it does), and about other random stuff that I didn’t not ask for or care about. I like airbnb because I’m very independent so having someone text me constantly was really annoying. I’m sure she had the best intentions but it was still annoying.\nI probably would not stay again for the communication and because I think there are other airbnbs with a better cost/quality ratio.', 'Very good choice we made, the photos and description fully coincided with the place.

The bed is comfortable and okay for a couple. I do recommend earplugs and eye mask (no curtains). Also the check in was fine but we didn’t receive clear instructions (dust bins, parking the car).

In addition, he did not stop sending us messages about House instructions. And worst of all we had to leave because the day before he informed us that He's going to spray the whole house against pests and we had to be outside all day-we told him we were not ready for that because we want to rest in the room And we pay for that time, he said that right And he will cancel it. and despite that, when we returned that morning We found him in our room moving our stuff and prepares the place for spraying.

Despite public transport links being quite close it’s still about 40 minutes to get anywhere and you have to change multiple times when with a car you can get to most locations in 15 -30 minutes. This is not Jose’s fault obviously, this is just travel in America - I ended up getting Ubers everywhere.\nThe place itself is a medium sized room that is relatively bare but has everything you could ever need. You share the house with Jose and his companion who from what I’ve experienced were lovely. I really enjoyed that I could just lock my room, switch on my tv and relax in the evenings. Do bare in mind that you share the bathroom and the kitchen with the other occupants - this was the only difficult aspect for me.

There is plenty of parking nearby but at night it was very difficult to find a parking space. However, Harding Ave, where the building is located, is less quiet. Traffic pass by here 24/7.

Better option than driving or getting a Lyft/Uber. Ordered door dash and it was delivered no problem to the location. Ksenia works at the main desk and was always friendly and helpful.

He arrived later than he had promised and there was frustration on both sides. Later that afternoon, he called my sister, who was at the beach and told her they had to leave the apartment right away and if they didn't he would call the police. They came home to vacate the apartment and he left my 60 year old sister and nephew out in the street. Just because he thought my nephew had been rude when complaining about the key system.

The place was beautifully decorated, the bed was soft, and the kitchen had everything you needed.\nAt times we felt as if we were the only ones in the entire building as we had the roof top pool to ourselves each time we went, and there was never a wait for the elevator.\nThe only thing I would recommend is a full length iron board or steamer as it was difficult to iron my dress"", 'Farah’s place was absolutely incredible. It was located in the perfect spot, walking distance to all the spots on Ocean Dr, yet further away to be quiet from all the noise of the nightlife. It was clean and equipped with everything we needed for our stay. We would LOVE to return. Thank you!!', 'You have to check in a few buildings down…which we did not know.

Very comfortable to be downtown and close to the beach. I don't recommend it when it's Ultra and Spring Break week because the area felt a bit dangerous. Very clean apartment but there is no broom or vacuum cleaner and the apartment is not cleaned, so I think something is missing so that as a guest you can keep the days of the stay clean. VERY UNCOMFORTABLE pillows. The rest very well"", 'Pros: very clean, comfortable (with exception of the pull-out couch bed), great location right across the street from the beach, hotel next door was willing to accept Amazon packages for us to get a few things we forgot to pack\nCons: dishes in cabinets weren’t very clean, the lobby smelled terrible during our stay (perhaps something gone wrong with the air conditioning), only a couple dishwasher tablets for the full stay, not many towels, no beach towels (an beach umbrella would be a plus, too), terrible/cheap paper towels and toilet paper, kitchen could be better stocked and with better knives. Perhaps the most basic need was a place to hang towels - there was no place for a hand towel; the two hooks didn’t allow bath towels to dry, and there was no where to hang additional beach towels, bath towels or swimsuits.\nIt is loud at night but mostly road noise.\nOverall, it’s a very clean and functional place to stay but it’s missing a couple points that could make it more comfortable.', ""Farah's place was beautiful! it did not match the photos, it far exceeded them. Modern, spacious, and fully stocked with towels and kitchen tools. The living room is a bit dim, but once the shades are lifted, the natural light illuminates the area. Location is by far the best!! directly across from the beach and alongside the main street filled with plenty of music and restaurants. It's also convenient located above a gelato and pizza shop. Parking is located next door and cash only with in and privileges. We can't wait to come back and stay here again."", 'Farah has the best place in South Beach. I visit Miami every year and I will always book my stay at Farah’s place.', 'What more could you ask for than to be on Ocean drive ""in the heart of the chicken😅""\nA lot of noise at night but completely normal in view of the situation.\nResponsive host.

Family friendly as well.', 'We had an incredible time. The apartment is extremely clean and fresh.', 'Fantastic location just 30 second walk to Muscle Beach; very easy to check in at the nearby hotel; hotel also provides towels for the beach; the rooftop pool was a minor disappointment, but that is a tiny thing given how great the location is to the beach. I would stay here again. Booking with Farah was super simple and a pleasure.', 'Amazing place next to south beach !! Great place and value for money !!!', ""Nice location, steps away from the beach and all the main attractions of south beach, but very bare-bones accommodation with literally nothing in the kitchen or anything to make the place especially comfortable. Many of the light bulbs were burned out and despite paying extra for having four people, we had to ask the host for extra supplies and then at check in they didn't even know that there would be four people."", 'Great place to stay at south beach miami. Check in was easy and the location was excellent.', 'The accommodation is great! The location is perfect: next to beach beach and restaurants. The rooftop Pool is lovely. Check in is easy.

Amazing', 'nice', 'Farah was a great host. Very fast at responding and answering any questions. Check in was very straightforward and easy. The place was clean and for any concerns we had, Farah was very easy to communicate with and accommodating to ensure we had a good experience. She goes above and beyond as a host. The location was my favorite part. Right at the end of Ocean drive with bicycle rentals, Walgreens, restaurants, parking and beach all less than a five minute walk away. Only downside I felt was sofa beds were a tad bit uncomfortable but when you’re on the go and just on it for a few hours, it didn’t bug me. And a rooftop view of Ocean Drive and the beach definitely made up for it. Also that’s a great place to watch a sunset. Overall would stay here again!', 'Perfect location and condo.

They loved it. Downstairs there is a gelato place and an awesome small restaurant with great breakfast and food.\nIt was seaweed season so the beach had seaweed all over, so one day we use an app named ResortPass, which allows you to buy a day pass at the nice resorts in the area, so we enjoyed the resort pool by the beach.', 'Beautiful Place , Clean and Spacious !Close by everything.

Ubers found the location easily and were always 3-5 minutes away, most of the restaurants and clubs were only a quick 20 minute ride, which was very convenient.

Two things to note: make sure when leaving the room to close the door all the way and press the lock button. The check in instructions explain this but it’s important to note that the door won’t lock on its own unless you press the lock button. Also be mindful that there are other people in the building. If you are traveling alone make sure to lock the door.

Maybe it would have helped a little...

It is a 6 min. walk to the beach, coffee shops and restaurants. The neighborhood is quiet, and calm. We felt really safe while walking around at night. The beach on this side of town is also a bit quieter, which I really appreciate. Overall our stay was nice!', 'The best thing about this unit is the location. You’re literally a 3 minute walk from the beach and a 10 minute drive from ocean drive and south beach. There are free trolley to take you around the city and comes in very clutch with the stop being right across the street. Only complaint I have or heads up is the shower takes a good 10 minutes or so to heat up so don’t be surprised like I was when it took a while to get some mild to hot water coming out and it wasn’t the cleanest or sparkliest bathroom. But if your in Miami to have fun and your not so much worried about the type of room you’re staying in then this is the perfect place.

Overall I was thrilled and would recommend and stay again!!', ""So my review on this place would be that it was mediocre. By the pictures I saw I expected a lot more cleanliness and for it to be a little better put together. When I initially arrived I had a few issues, one was that I didn't like the odor it didn't smell fresh.. I didn't like that the sheets when I checked them had hair on them when I was told that the room was cleaned.. The mattress was very thin.. The shower and the tub was not the cleanest.. no wash clothes to wash yourself, just dry towels given. Also I had issues with working the TV, it had to be manual! Now with all that being said, I do have to say once I reported issues to the host Roxana she did have the cleaning crew come in the same night and try to appease me but I feel that everything should have been done prior to me arriving especially for the money I paid to be there. Just like a hotel you have expectations when you're coming to live somewhere for a certain amount of time and you pay money, things should be done the right way from the beginning. I made it the best I could because I traveled there for my birthday, I have to say that was the thing I enjoyed least. The location was great.. close to a lot, Uber and Lyft was my best friend. Would I personally stay there again, NO! Maybe close by"", 'Clean and very easy check in process.

While Airbnb refunded me partially (with credits and partial refund) based on the problems after I sent videos and photos (the host at first offered a one night refund and would not agree to more), I would not stay here again.\nGenerally the apartment was in poor repair, but most importantly there were bugs in the bathroom and kitchen area. While the host did send someone to spackle over one of the holes in the wall and apparently spray for bugs, the condition of the apartment is not up to the caliber of what I have generally found to be at Airbnbs.', 'Roxana’s apartment is absolutely awesome! It is super convenient to everything, right across the street from the beach. Blocks away from all the wonderful Miami hotels and restaurants. Roxana was super friendly and responsive. If we find ourselves back in Miami, we will look for this apartment!', ""Useful apartment 2 blocks from the beach. Instructions to enter building and apartment were clear. Bed was great, AC was working perfectly. Shower pressure could've been a little better. Good deal for a weekend"", ""Roxana was very quick to respond when we had questions. However, for most of the time, I seemed to disturb the host with my simple questions and felt like a question. The airbnb was clean and still had everything we needed. If you are not by car, this is not the best location for you, there is nothing nearby (the beach is between 6 to 15 mins walk so correct). Bus stops are close to the airbnb but don't stop sometimes, hence the fact that you need a car.

Rafael left 4 towels for nos. I want to suggest some kind of action against the ants. You can't leave anything on the sink because it fills with ant. Another important point is the need for air conditioning maintenance because it dripped heavily on the bedroom floor. On the day it rained we identified a roof leak through the wall of the small room to store the bags.

The parking space is located on 7th floor and there were no problem parking with a medium suv. About 5 minutes it took to reach the parking floor if you are an experienced driver. On 14th floor you could find a small gym, playroom for kids and 2 large pools and a jacuzzi. The pools were set on different temperatures, one very warm and the other slightly colder. The only slightly negative I can think of is that in the morning when we went to the pool, we did find cigarette butts and vaping devices on several occations in the pool from pre-parties the day before, this could be regulated a bit harder. Although the pool area were kept clean in general.

I like to spend a lot of time in the living room but the couch made it extremely uncomfortable, it felt like i was sitting on a bench, it was very hard and i ended up spending most of my time sitting on the rug on the ground in the living room in front of the TV.

Clive was very friendly and responsive. Even we had a small issue with the heating unit as it was never used before in heat setting, he has done everything to make it work.

So, highly recommended!', ""I'd gladly recommend Clive's condo to anyone wanting the downtown Miami high-rise experience. Exactly as described, what other reviewers have said, and exactly as shown in the pictures. Awesome place, great experience, Clive is everything you'd want in an Airbnb host. Any time we had a question, Clive responded quickly by both Airbnb message or text (whichever was sent). We didn't have any issues to report. The location is perfect, just below the penthouse, views are excellent. The main island off in the distance of the view is literally South Beach.

The only thing I needed were more wash cloths for the stay :-) Sadly the restaurant in the building was closed for renovations, but it allowed you to bring your own beverages and food to the pool. The pool on the 8th floor was perfect, a nice size, warm water and a great view. 5 out of 5 stars to Lorelei, total pro! thanks again, Jim', 'Fantastic spot in a great area. Gym and pool amenities were convenient. Would definitely rebook at a future date.', ""The room was located in the former Sonesta Hotel in Coconut Grove - it's a lovely, walkable location and the room itself was fastidiously clean and comfortable, very true to the photos in the listing. The internet was excellent and the amenities were great - the pool and hot tub are located on a beautiful terrace overlooking a spectacular view of Miami. It was truly a wonderful, comfortable room.\nThis next part is for those who have needs, or low-risk tolerance, around covid-safety:\nFor context, I stayed at this listing to be close to my parents and be able to visit over the holidays, (one of whom is immunocompromised and has cancer), but in a way that would be safe and eliminate any risk. Additionally, I have an autoimmune disease.\nThe two key factors for eliminating that risk for me have been high-grade masking and proper ventilation. When I first arrived at the room, I panicked, concerned that the windows were sealed shut; Daniela & Lorelei were extremely communicative, rapidly responsive (even with a very late night text), and immediately helped get a person to check out the windows right away. And now, the windows can be opened - be careful, the room is quite high up, so I wouldn't open them much - but for ventilation and medical safety purposes, they were perfect.\nOn this topic, the airbnb is in a building that functions very much like a hotel, meaning you'll be sharing space with lots of other people when entering and exiting the room, and the guests and staff were extremely cavalier about Covid-19 safety practices. While there, there was, at one point, only one elevator that was functioning out of four (likely this won't be your experience) - and I quietly would avoid sharing an elevator with groups of unmasked individuals. But it would often take 10-15 minutes to get an empty elevator or one with only a few other masked folks.\nFurthermore, I had a very unpleasant exchange with a staff member who helped me get my luggage down but not only didn't have a mask on him, but refused to wear one, went from friendly to extremely cold when I asked, and began interrogating me about my dad's cancer condition. Ultimately, we went down in different elevators, which worked out great, but it seems that he took this request to wear a mask when sharing an elevator quite personally and politically.\nWith Omicron, there's a chance there will be fewer unmasked groups of teenagers squeezing into the elevators, but if this is a concern for you, it might be helpful to know that it's very easy to feel covid-safe in the room, but a little more of a challenge (not impossible, but hard boundary setting and speaking up) to be covid-safe throughout The Arya building where the room is located."", ""Lorelei's lodging in right in the middle of Coconut Grove. Great restaurants are nearby. The area is safe and we enjoyed evening community events.\nThe unit itself is just right for 2 adults. Very clean and just what we needed. Nice size bath.

I came into town for a baseball game at the Marlins' stadium and the unit is right across the street. I also noted that it's maybe ten minutes from Miami International Airport. The bed was comfortable, and it was clean. It's right on a main road, so there will be noise from the traffic, which I suppose would be expected, and a lot of outside light comes into the room at night, so if that's an issue for you, be sure to wear a sleep mask.

Randy was responsive and helpful the couple of times I reached out to him.', 'the overall stay is very good, just highlight a few things, as other users have already said, it is true that it smells a little humid when you enter on the first day, there are two photos of the patio where there is supposed to be the barbecue that I did not see in my corner as well as I did not see the barbecue, I also have to say that I did not ask for it, but overall for me it deserves a 5 star.', 'Great place in little Havana. The host made a candy from a small house. Since the cabin is small and there is everything, there is little space inside, but you can accommodate. Inside there are crockery and cooking utensils, washer and dryer. As a compliment, the host left a soda. There are even condiments for food, only a little ketchup, but this is not an issue.\nComfortable bed with clean sheets Outside the cabin is a small patio with a sofa to sit in. You can see that the host is trying to make guests feel comfortable.\nThe car can be parked in front of the gate.\nThe only problem is the air conditioners. The exterior units from the air conditioners of the neighboring large house are quite noisy and can be heard in the cabin, so if you sleep sensitively, then take your ear protection. This problem is unresolved. The interior units of the air conditioners in the house itself need to be cleaned. This issue is solvable.\nOtherwise, everything is great and wonderful. Thanks Randy for your hospitality! Guests are advised not to forget to take a walk in little Havana.))', 'Randy’s place was nestled in a quiet tucked away road of Little Havana.

It was the perfect space for my cousin and I and for my recovery! It was quiet and residential but walking distance to Calle Ocho! We went to lunch and dinner twice along Calle Ocho and loved it. After surgery, it was easy for Instacart to find. Absolutely loved that! Randy responded quickly with a local recommendation for us and otherwise left us alone. We cooked breakfast, lunch and dinner in every night after surgery and kitchen well stocked with everything we needed. You do hear planes going over head but after the second day I honestly didn’t notice! I highly recommend Randy’s place to anyone and for my surgery dolls, also highly recommend!', 'The cottage was lovely, safe, clean and very private. It was a perfect location for accessing the city.

We turned up for an Air B n B listing that we were not at all comfortable staying at. Needing somewhere else fast, we found Randy\'s listing. Despite being late in the day he, and his family were EXTREMELY accommodating. They prepared the cottage and got it ready for us immediately and did a great job.\nTheir cottage is perfect for a couple/small family that needs somewhere comfortable to stay. The location is nice/convenient, it\'s really clean, very tastefully furnished and has everything you need for a short stay in comfort. The thing that really sets this listing apart is that you can tell that Randy and family prioritise their guests\' comfort and make the effort accordingly. Nothing was the bare minimum. Really Great Job.\nIf you are put off by the cottage being a ""back house"" at the owner\'s home, don\'t be. Privacy is not an issue at all. We didn\'t see or even need to interact with Randy after the initial booking and confirmation discussion.', 'I was in town for a job interview and I’ve never been to the city before. This place was perfect for me. It was easily walkable to Calle Ocho and a manageable drive to Coconut Grove.

I asked to change the sleeping arrangements for the third person, but the solution Tyler offered was to get the bed fixed next morning only (legs of the sofa were missing), sleep there during the night, and put something under the couch to straighten it.

We could not imagine three adults sleeping on the main bed, so we left and found a new accommodation with help of the Airbnb support.

It was one bathroom we shared with everyone but never had an issue when I needed to use it. Super friendly and always offering me food or other things in case I needed it.

Pleasure to stay there and would highly recommend.', 'La Tia is wonderful. First day she offered me fresh cantaloupe and assisted me with wheeling heavy luggage into her home from my Lyft vehicle.\nWord to the wise with English speaking guests, please use G00gle Translate instead of Airbnb\'s translator, since La Tia prefers to communicate in Spanish in the app, but can speak and understand English with in-person interactions. I highlight because Airbnb\'s translator can sometimes confuse or mis-translate common Spanish words.\nThe area or neighborhood itself is safe to walk at night, but as you start heading North, past Highway 41, into Little Havana proper, it can be a little questionable, especially for a güero!

4.84",222,Superhost,8 years hosting,€ 60 x 5 nights,"['First I want to say the host was very nice person. Polite and nice so I am quite sorry to write my feedbacks which I felt not comfortable.\nFirst, when I got there the weather was cold. The heater from the air condition system didn’t work. The host supplied extra blanket but it was not enough for me.\nSecondly, because of the door connected to the host house, during my stay I kinda had to suffered from the dogs(5dogs) barking at night since my plan to stay there to study for my training. Even I can hear clearly the host family talking. If i can hear them, also they can hear me with small noice I will make. Therefore, I had to keep quiet as much as I can do. It was a quiet a stress for me.\nThirdly, for a ppl who stays long like me(12days), you have to request more shampoo or body soap quite early enough. The host told me to wait like 2-4days to get refilled.\nBesides these, the host was nice and very nice person but the price I spent($128) was a bit over valued in my opinion.', 'The host was very accommodating.', 'Great place to stay!

There were a few issues with cleanliness with the worst being we found a giant cockroach in our bathroom the first night (of just two nights). We ultimately told Gloria who was very apologetic and said she would look into the issue, which we appreciated. The other thing that bothered us were that the walls were thin, so we could hear the other tenants (either other guests or Gloria and her family) through the wall and felt we had to speak very softly when in our room as to not disturb others in the house.

This can be OK if you stay for just 1 or 2 nights, but we definitely recommend brining some good earplugs.\nThe communication with the host was very friendly and respectful.

However, the shower has space and is lovely and easy to figure out. The downside (& why I say it's good for a couple nights) is that there is NO CLOSET. And therefore you cannot hang up your clothes. The space, itself, is really cute and spacious and the art makes it even better! You are -literally- surrounded by art! If you're not into art, this space is not for you.

Recommended except for those with light sleep…\nFabien and Whitney"", 'Perfect, clean, comfortable and quiet. Highly recommended', 'My 2 nights at Michael\'s airbnb was nice. The unit was clean, cozy, and peaceful. Walkable to everything. If I had to list any cons, it would only be for the two listed below:\n1) A stronger shower-head with better water pressure is very much needed.\n2) The front room area with all the windows needs to be blocked off with a separate curtain OR blackout curtains need to be added. The morning light was pretty bright. There are VERY nice blackout curtains near the bed, but it\'s almost for nothing since brightness comes in from the front.\nYes, these things are subjective and it didn\'t ""ruin"" my stay, but it would\'ve added to the experience immensely. This is not a complaint...it\'s just something to be mindful of.\nLastly, parking on the street is for residents only and there are signs EVERYWHERE saying so. Michael can register your vehicle as a resident for $20/day if you desire. I parked at a garage nearby to avoid the extra work for Michael. Try not to bring a car if you can resist.', 'I only stayed at Michael’s place one night, but it was a very good experience that I would recommend to others. Check-in was easy and well-explained, the apartment was clean with all the essentials, the location of the Airbnb was great, and Michael was incredibly helpful.

Maybe a few more towels and linens would be nice. Shouldn’t have to do laundry for a two night stay but we had to. Other than that everything was fantastic.

There are dispensers in the shower that are mislabeled — the “conditioner” is bubble bath, and the “shower gel” is shampoo. I used them as they were labeled and later found the bottles under the sink which definitely was not a great feeling. The balcony lock does not work.\nSome positives were that the host allowed early check-in for a small fee and there are lots of things to do within walking distance. There is a notable homeless population in the area, not disturbing or anything but just something to be aware of if you’re not accustomed to seeing that. The gentleman at the desk at check-in was very friend as well as everyone else in the building and the valet.', 'This place is wonderful place to stay in Miami. Convenient location and just a short drive/Uber to south beach. Plenty of bars and restaurants within walking distance. The pool was the best part of the airbnb.', 'I had a wonderful stay here. The views are amazing. The bed was really comfortable, but the covers make you really hot at night. Make sure to bring extra face and body wash towels, as there were only one. The table was also different from the photos, it was older wooden one. The washer and dryer cleaned my clothes amazingly. I didn’t use the balcony as I didn’t expect to be so afraid, but be careful as nets and palmetto bugs can get in really quickly. It was one on the window while we were opening it, but closed the door fast enough for it not to get in. Building staff did check in twice. Overall this was a great stay. I have to add the shower has amazing water pressure and gets hot. I would recommend staying here. It felt luxury.', 'Being on the 18th floor that view is amazing. The place is beautiful and had everything we need it. Extremely comfortable for a couple. Claudia communication was wonderful and extremely helpful. Made sure our check in went smoothly. Location is super close to everything specially Bayside. Only down size we were not able to use the parking garage due to my husband truck was over 6’2 but that’s no where in the notes or mention wish we knew. But I’m the bright side they have valet parking and we just left it the whole weekend and walked or took Uber for cheap. Will definitely be visiting again.', 'Great place , would book again.', 'It’s was a great stay in prime location.

If you’re looking for a relaxing stay or more of a party scene, this location would be great for both. Walking distance to so many different attractions, restaurants, bars, etc. You’re a short walk from the Bayside Marketplace and that’s pretty relaxing during the evening.\nI didn’t have problems with access to the apartment and it was pretty easy to find. You get your own key and elevator fob to come and go as you please. I didn’t use the parking pass since I used Uber my entire stay so I can’t give any reviews on that. Wifi was great.

This stay is outside the hubbub of downtown but easily reachable by bus or car. There is a really neat historic district and small park by the water that we enjoyed walking around.

We would definitely stay again if we were in the area!', 'Very cozy, clean place', 'Veronica was responsive and allowed an early check-in which was incredibly helpful! Unfortunately, I didn’t realize there wouldn’t be ventilation in the tiny home so it was damp. If you are sensitive to this and have allergies I wouldn’t recommend this place. I got sick from this and was immediately better upon leaving. There was an AC unit.\nI don’t blame the host, but now I know to check about ventilation in the future due to my sensitivities. Keep in mind this is a tiny home so it is a bit crammed and the lighting isn’t great but if you are looking for something in Miami that is boho and small, this is it. The location is great for walking to restaurants, etc.\nI’d also recommend bug spray if you want to be on the patio.', 'A very nice stay in Miami.

We had a long day of travel, and were just looking for a little music to celebrate and pregame, at a decent hour especially. It's our first day of vacation, just trying to let loose a little, remember that!\nNonetheless, it doesnt change my opinion of the overall property- the property was beautiful and well taken care of. Great location, only about 10-15 minutes from downtown and cruise ports. Hosts are welcoming and provide clear instruction on the property itself.

Very nice little spot, cozy, perfect size for one or a couple. The bed was comfy and the little coffee maker is a life saver.

There were also loud construction noises happening. I think once these construction updates are complete it will be fine; however, I don't think it is appropriate to still be operating this unit while major construction is happening for the safety of the lodgers.

We loved having the beach just across the street to go swim every morning!', 'Enjoyed my stay and the place was just as advertised! Check in was easy thanks to very clear instructions. The host was so gracious to let me arrive early too! I was in town for Basel so while this location was a bit further from South Beach it was nice to be away from the craziness! The building is a bit older but that was not representative of the apartment at all which was nicely updated! It is in a busy area so you will hear city noises. This was no problem for me as it was the perfect stop after busy days and late nights. The best part was truly the distance to the beach though, it definitely doesn’t get any better than this!

Lots to do within walking distance and there was a well-stocked closet with beach chairs, towels, ice chest, and just about anything you could need. On our second evening we pulled up to find three police cars in front of the building with their lights on. We soon realized they simply stopped for pastelitos and coffee at the downstairs restaurant, Sazon Cubano. Excellent spot for cafe y pastelitos. Strongly recommend this spot and we would definitely visit again.\nSide note: There were barricades for construction however it did not impact our visit at all.

Pking is about 1/hr b/w 8-6 but don't forget to go back into the app on time because you can only park in 2 hr increments and then you have to go back in ( so set your alarm for 7am to 8). There's also a huge parking across the street.\nThe only thing we would suggest is not to have the bed on the floor (modern type with frame).Maybe that's great for young people, physically fit or even short...but we are average fitness tall people lol.\nMatress was great asks comfortable!"", 'Overall, my husband and I had a wonderful experience. The check in and out process was easy and stress free. Although, I am sure the host has nothing to do with this, we did feel inconvenienced when someone had to come spray for pests. Again, we understand it isn’t their fault, we were just was thrown for a loop and then bluntly asked by the pest guys if we’ve seen any roaches. I am glad I did not see any and that everyone is being proactive in preventing the critters from coming. The host was able to facilitate the guys coming at a time that was MORE convenient for us so we did not have to wait all day for them and apologized for their need to come.\nThe host was amazing at responding to our questions.

The value for this stay was fantastic. For budget conscious travelers here for events at the MACC this was a great recommend, and I would probably stay again.\nVery minor cons: General area has mosquitos, so keeping the AC down is a must if you leave the door open for any amount of sustained time. Not much they can do about it but just something to be aware of as you come in to have a better stay.\nTP is provided but pretty flimsy, maybe bring your own if you have a preference.\nOverall this was a fantastic stay, with very little and tiny downsides.

Highly recommend! :)', 'The property is very well located, close to Miami Beach and its attractions and the airport as well.

It's a bit hard to tell from the photos, but it's actually a suite in a building with another unit and on the same property as another little bungalow.

Highly recommend', 'Lovely place to stay in Miami. We felt safe in the neighborhood. Very easy check in process. If you like the amenities of an apartment rather than a hotel room, this is the perfect place. It is very clean with lovely decor that made the place feel upscale. They also have a very nice outdoor spot to chill when it gets cooler outside. Located in MiMo and near the main boulevard, it was so easy to pick different restaurants to dine in. We prefer using public transportation in big cities so their location was very convenient for taking the city buses and just connect to their trains or Metromover. But if you have your own transportation, there is available street parking outside. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and highly recommend it.', 'Beautiful space , Great location and Manuel is a excellent Host ; I would definitely recommend this place for a relaxing place to stay at Miami !', 'I have filed discrimination against Manuel and his partner Allan. I landed at 7pm in Miami from Chicago and had a conversation, upon arrival at the property, with the hosts. It was me and my girlfriend. The next day we went out to the city to visit and do some shopping around 1pm. I stopped at a spot on south beach to enjoy a cigar then left to return home around 9p. 5 minutes after we entered our room, Manuel knocks on ou door and says “We smell marijuana, do you smell it too?” While he’s inquiring about the smell he’s looking behind me suspicious that we might be smoking. He started sniffing from from the door. Let me be clear...I have ZERO TOLERANCE or patience when it comes to discrimination. That’s UNACCEPTABLE!!! Are you asking me about the marijuana because I’m black? I don’t understand why you would knock on a guest’s door, disturbing whatever they had going on, to ask about marijuana. Everyone can clearly see that the property is NON SMOKING and there are signs everywhere especially when he’s already being disrespectful to a guest about smoking in his review. Why would you think that I would smoke in your place considering all that? Do you think your guests are stupid? Your policy is clear “NO SMOKING ANYWHERE IN THE PROPERTY” and I totally respect that especially since I’m a host myself.\nBut let’s say for the sake of the argument that I had marijuana in my person, smelled like marijuana or had a marijuana in my luggage (We are talking about a legal amount here because let’s face it, marijuana is legal in many states in America and I personally had hosts from California, Washington, etc. so they can potentially have marijuana on them and legally too, if they have a member card). That’s why they (guests) pay a “Cleaning fee” and in Manuel’s case an additional service fee as well. If a guest smokes outside of your property, it doesn’t take a full cleaning service to remove any smell that they may have dragged with them from the outside. As long as they don’t directly smoke inside the unit, any other smell should be easily removable with the cleaning fee that they paid you. Anyways, what gives you, Manuel, the right to question me based on a smell or how I smell? Why do you equate my smell to marijuana without seeing any evidence of marijuana? Why do you equate the smell of marijuana or cigars in this case to someone actually smoking inside your property? The smell of a cigar or marijuana although distinct is nothing like the smell of actually smoking marijuana or cigar which is what YOUR POLICY prohibits. So not only these two don’t want people to smoke in their property, they are monitoring how their guests SMELL. Image paying for a non smoking hotel room and being questioned by the front desk after smoking outside and returning to your room that you paid for, cleaning fee and all - ABSURD, I’m not 12 yrs old and have to report to you. You providing a service that I paid you for, less the harassment.\nLook, simply change your policy to NON-SMOKER ONLY that way anyone that smokes anything know not to book your place. Problem solved. Don’t make ppl uncomfortable just because you don’t like the smell of a substance whether its cigars, cigarettes, hookah or something else.\nI was upset. This man and his partner had a conversation with us a day prior and can clearly see that we are expecting, so why would you think in your right mind that I would lock myself in your room and smoke and jeopardize her health? Are you that ignorant to think that people don’t see the signs? Why would anyone think that we would hot box ourselves with smoke while we’re pregnant and you can clearly see that she is? I do not take discrimination lightly. I told him that we smelled a weird scent in the bedroom and what if we did the same and attributed that smell to your lifestyle...how would you feel? So why do it to others when clearly they are not smoking. I opened the door wide open and ask Manuel to go inside while I step away and run a FULL WALKTHROUGH of the place to find ANY evidence of smoking or marijuana. I insisted that he goes in and checks the place THROUGHLY and he DECLINED the offer. The door was wide open and he was standing there refusing to enter. He left and entered their unit which is next door. I knocked on their door and ask him to cancel our reservation and issue a FULL REFUND and informed him that I will be checking out the next day. I called Airbnb and filed discrimination against the host - he’s response when I told him that I will report this was “I’m not white, how am I discriminating against you” (that shows you the level of ignorance that you would have to deal with if you choose to stay there). These people are misrepresenting their position on smoking and lying on their guests. Now I truly believe that Manuel made up the story about the other guests in the review to cover his himself. Airbnb MUST shut them down IMMEDIATELY and issue a FULL refund for misrepresentation, discrimination, prejudice and inconvenience...We are expecting and I had to book another Airbnb that same night last minute. Instead of enjoying our vacation we had to deal with these guys at our first stop, Miami. How inconvenient. What kind of people do that to a couple that’s expecting???', 'We had a fantastic stay at Alan and Manuel’s place. It was sparkling clean upon our arrival and very true to the pictures. We were within 20 minutes of most of the sites in Miami that we wanted to see which was very convenient, also close to the airport. We were very comfortable the entire time, and it was a great bonus to have a washer and dryer available for us to use. Alan and Manuel were active on the app and provided an exceptional experience!', 'Great location! The hosts have done an amazing job with thinking of anything you’ll need while away. The place was comfortable and clean. Would love to return the next time I’m in Miami!', 'Overall great stay. Nice size for the apartment for two people I would even say 3 would be able to stay here. Literally right down the street is a lot of restaurants and etc walking distance away. We had a car and there was always parking on the street. Only complaint is that the WiFi didn’t work at all while being there but we weren’t really at the house so it wasn’t a big deal for us but I know that may be a big thing for someone else. Also I texted the number in the packet on the counter and no one answered but when I messaged them through the Airbnb app they did answer (I’m guessing it might be an old number). Either way the response time was good overall. Again the space was great and I would stay here again.', ""I stayed in Manuel and Alan's place for 3 weeks while in Miami for work. The place is as described and pictured. It was a great and well-located home base for my needs. The neighborhood is pretty and peaceful while being close enough to Biscayne to walk to multiple restaurants and other destinations."", 'We liked the accommodation‘s beach house style and its location. Everything in Miami was within great driving distance. Manuel was easy to communicate with and he was very friendly. What you should know is that the A/C cannot be controlled/regulated by the guests themselves. There’s a lock around the A/C system. Manuel checked and regulated the temperature for us, but we froze during the nights and are not used to such cold temperatures in the room. The temperature in the room felt much colder than displayed. We also struggled with the low water pressure in the shower.', 'Perfect clean and great place. near to Bayside, Brickell and everything!!\nAllan and Manuel allways were ready to give us the better experience possible...\nDefinitiley this place is a diamond in Miami!! 🤩', 'Very clean great location nice privacy', 'This place and the host is great for a private get away.

You must trust their recommendations for local restaurants, they know good food and wine!', 'Manuel’s place was perfect! It was in a great location, near lots of restaurants. SoBe, Wynwood, Little Havana, all within a short drive. Everything was as pictured and although we didn’t cook, there was plenty of pots, pans, etc. Would def recommend.', 'Hello air bnb family! Well first let me start off saying the stay was great! I love the walkable distance to everything. Overall, I enjoyed my stay! Now, if you are going to stay here you must know this is not a private entrance residence. The only thing between you and another family will be a wall. If you are scrolling through the pictures you will see the entrance to your rental; to your immediate right there is a door for the additional family. So, when I knew there would be at least 2 ppl on the property, it was actually a total of 7 ppl living on this property.

Nice addition was having toiletries mounted to the shower wall so no need to bring hair shampoo or body wash. And for the ladies it was also nice to have a full size mirror. Another great amenity was the washer and dryer. It was very accessible and easy to use. Another convenient amenity was door codes. Not having to keep up with keys is super hassle free. The Ac was a tad noisy in the bedroom but still very functional.

Manuel checked we had arrived ok and messaged a few times during & at the end of our stay to make sure everything was fine (it was). A roomy very comfortable suite with everything needed for our 5 night stay it was just right. Biscayne Blvd is only a few mins walk away with bus stops close by as well as several nice bars & restaurants. It was so quiet at night too and the neighbourhood seemed fine. A great location to go to either downtown Miami or up to South Beach etc. enabling us to explore this fantastic city in 5 days and I would highly recommend it :)', 'beautiful, spacious suite!!

Parking was easy to find on the street right outside the house and there was even a friendly neighborhood cat who walked us home from the car one night :) Responses were quick and helpful from both Alan and Manuel, and Alan even went out of his way to help resolve a small technical difficulty so we would have a great experience. He also recommended some great places for us to grab dinner and drinks nearby. We would gladly stay at Manuel and Alan’s place next time we are in Miami!

It was extremely clean, very comfortable and we felt welcomed from the moment Manuel met us to let us in. We did not have to wait on arrival, there was water (and drinks) in the fridge, coffee, towels, toilet paper, the place was well decorated, cozy and the bed was comfortable. There was soothing music coming out of the TV and so many other great touches. We had complete privacy and Manuel was very responsive and took care of all our needs almost immediately.

Sweet place and walking distance from a great vegan bakery.', ""Janelle and Maria's property is 4 miles from the lairport and 13 miles from Miami, grocery stores and restaurants were within 1 mile. The property is similar to a duplex but the family next door is friendly. If you do not like cats, I would not stay at this property. There were a lot of cats around the property. With that being said we had an excellent stay."", 'Good location. Very helpful and easy to communicate with. Clean and accommodating', 'Everything was better than expected, felt like home.', 'This was the perfect home.! Quiet safe neighborhood close to everything I did Lyft during my stay I paid no more than $5.00-$16.00 to get to different restaurants, pools , markets and more in the Miami area.

Book you won’t be disappointed', 'Awesome experience!', 'We absolutely loved our stay @ Maria and Janelle’s place. The place itself was very nice; communication was perfect; as was the location. Be sure to visit Tinta y Cafe (walking distance) for delicious coffee and breakfast items. Also the free trolley is located just a couple of blocks away and takes you to Miracle Mile & other stops! A great find!!', 'The washer and dryer that are offered is limited according to how long your stay is and it’s also shared, the back patio is shared between you and the people next door which was not stated before booking.

So pretty and clean Clean CLEAN! Also conveniently located to everything! She was a great host. I wish I could live there !!!! So pretty !!! And cozy', 'This was a great place to stay for our visit to Miami. Great location, cozy, ultra quiet home in a really sweet neighborhood. Easy to get to downtown Coral Gables and other great Miami areas. It felt a little snug for three people (we went with our adult daughter) especially when the pull out sofa was being used. We didn’t mind but worth mentioning. We loved starting and ending our day hanging out on the screened in front patio. Really enjoyed our stay. Would definitely stay again!

Second time I stayed and it was again, a pleasure. Even when I had a personal issue they were understanding and very positive and polite about everything.

Didn't realize the enclosed lanai was off the bedroom so bringing breakfast food and beverages outside was a bit challenging.\nThe home appeared bigger in the pictures with the bathroom and bedroom being smaller than anticipated.\nOtherwise, it was a great stay. The area has so much to do and the restaurants were great."", 'Great place to stay, certainly for the money !', 'We enjoyed staying where Janelle and Maria. Perfect place for us for the location and well equipped with all that is necessary. Neighborhood is quiet and beautiful.

She lives in the other half of the house thus you have quick access to her.\nThings to consider:\n- There is not a lot of open space. Anything more than one couple sharing a bed will be crowded.\n- The neighborhood is quite and nice for walking but there are no conveniences in the surrounding few blocks. The walk to the fun restaurant and shopping areas is about 15-minutes. In comfortable shoes no problem, in fancy shoes it would be too far.\n- There is a private space to park you car, but it will get a lot of leaves and bird droppings. If this is a significant concern you can probably park down the street a bit.\nOver all I give it high marks!', 'Nice stay. Hosts are very accomodating and polite. Clean and well equipped place. Parking space a little tight for my husbands truck but he managed. Will recommend.', 'Great stay and great location! Thanks for having us!', 'Very clean and beautiful Airbnb!

A place we could move into for a couple days, go out and have adventures, and come back to at the end of the day to watch a few YouTube videos, have a shower, make a snack, and get a great night's sleep. Missions accomplished!\nThe location is great as well - only a few minutes from the airport, Miami Beach and many activities (Vizcaya, escape rooms, Winwood, the zoo, etc.).

All kinds of kitchen staples, great collection of kitchen tools, flatware, plates, cups, etc. Perfect for a couple, we were two friends and the pull-out couch worked great. Air-conditioners in both the living room and the bedroom did a great job of keeping us comfortable.

I’ve used air bnb for all of my trips in the past year and ha e never had a bad review. We washed linen and washed dishes as directed. We did have an hour delay on our flight due to weather and the host acted very inappropriate and non understanding in the situation. As far as wax damage the candle had already been burned to the point of over drip and I did the favor of breaking it off before resuming burn. I don’t know if we were the perfect opportunity for this host to make false accusations against us to try and update some of their dated accommodations but bro shirts my feelings. As a business owner and a very responsible person in life general this review actually makes me physically sick and has caused me and my partner major frustration and confusion onto why this would be their resort. I pray for them that find peace from these false accusations and that Hod forgives them for such harsh judgment and assumed penalty.', 'Stayed twice and it was just perfect.', 'This house is lovely.

Maria Luisa provided us with towels for the pool, sea and shower, shampoo, pots, stove and everything that was necessary for our accommodation. Convenient location for turning around and a fairly clean pool. We didn't like his way at a moment: while he was available to offer us everything we needed, she felt like we could judge our choice to prefer a homemade pasta to a restaurant dinner, as if we couldn't use her kitchen availability.

4.99",168,Superhost,4 years hosting,€ 144 x 5 nights,"[""From the beginning until the end of our stay, it was a pleasurable experience! Cory is by far the best host I have encountered. His high level of professionalism, attention to detail, willingness to rectify any issue(although there were none), and kindness echoed the level of hospitality and care we received on this stay, and made us feel safe and welcomed. Upon our arrival we were met at the entrance by Cory who explained everything we needed to know, and helped us check in, although the key could have been left at the front desk. When in the unit, we uncovered little 'nuggets' of gifts and notes that Cory left around the place to help personalize our stay. The caveat for me was him purchasing our groceries and packing them out BEFORE we got there!!!!! This means so much to me. The unit comes well equipped to meet our needs, offering above average of what is expected. For example, yoga mat, clothes steamer, an office area with pens and such, waterproof plastic phone holder so you can use your phone while under water, and so much more!\nFor those who are sensitive to noise, please be aware that there is a highway close by, but Cory has left earbuds in the unit to help rectify that potential issue. This unit is also within walking distance to the Miami Design District; which is visible from the balcony. The heated pool on the 6th floor is a must! All around, wonderful experience! 10/10! I highly recommend!!"", 'By far one of my favourite air bnbs, the location, aesthetic and amenities are perfect.\nLocated in the design district it was central to all places in Miami, being only 10-15 minutes away from every single thing we did was amazingly convenient.\nThe building is in top shape being fairly new, it has such a luxury and premium feel, with its rooftop pool and gym. The small things like the air fresheners in the hallways and elevators are top notch.\nThe unit is so well kept by Cory having everything we needed to make our stay as perfect as could be. From the kitchen utensils to the beach chairs and cooler, to have these thing’s accessible during our stay made it feel like home.\nCory as a host is A1, by far one of the most attentive and helpful hosts I’ve stayed with. Always quick replies, and always assisting when needed.\n10/10\nCan’t wait to visit Miami again!', 'Great stay, would highly recommend.

His place is absolutely spotless (this is coming from someone who travels with every disinfectant and cleans everything before my stay); with Cory’s place, there was simply no need to. Amenities ++++. On site pool, grilling, and lounge area. Location is amazing; I opted to not drive this stay and never spent more than $7-12 dollars on an Uber/ Lyft. He does, however, provide parking tags if you need. We visited the full extent of Miami Beach with yacht rides for millionaire row tour and dinner at Havana 1957; the bayside marketplace which is great for quick bites (hurricane jet and sky views are also super fun); baseball game at the loandepot stadium; superblue (interactive museum experience); frost museum; Perez art museum; Versace’s mansion; La industria (best pancakes ever); wynwood walls.

Cory is extremely responsive and gives very good recommendations if you need it . We were traveling with our boys and Cory left 2 stuffed baby gators on the kids bed.

Cory met me at the lobby and assist me in the check-in process which was quick and easy. He gave me a thorough apartment tour and guided me to my own parking space in the garage. When he left me that was the last time I spoke with him until it was time to check-out because I did not have a need or want for anything. The place was immaculate and had every thing that I could ever want. From detergent to wash my clothes, soap for the dish washer, cooking utensils and cutlery to an iPhone cord that I needed for my rental for apple car-play. Even the details that I appreciated like my name on the whiteboard in the closet to the welcome card on the island counter and the fresh croissants and fruit. Even a recipe for a cocktail with the ingredients supplied. If you want to BBQ in the common area, there was tools for that. If you wanted to do yoga, there was mats and supplies for that. If you wanted to go to the beach, there were towels and chairs for that. There were even earplugs on the side of the bed because of the slight noise from idiots racing on the highway in the morning (which had nothing to do with the place). There I mostly ate on the porch cause the great view and large outdoor space. My only regret was not using the pool and gym, but my schedule was booked for my stay. If I had to do it again I would have stayed and additional 2 days to take in everything. The location was perfect! It was 10 min from the airport and 15 min from south beach (with no traffic). All other events that I had to attend were 15-30 mins away which was great. Grocery shopping and shopping malls were in walking distance. When i come back to Miami if this place is not booked this will be the place that I stay from now own. DON'T THINK ABOUT IT, JUST BOOK IT.

Now If you will be taking a Lyft/Uber or anyone picking you up from the property, they expect this pick up / drop off to be done inside the property and not outside which is nearly impossible when it’s an Uber / Lyft and since the property is gated and has to be manually opened.\nSome of their rules were extremely absurd, one being they ask AC is turned off every time when leaving which if you have been in S.FL is extremely hot specially during SUMMER. I completely understand saving on electricity as I too am a homeowner and rent out a studio on the side of my home in Tampa, so best suggestion for this, is either putting the rule to leaving AC at 75.\nOther absurd rule is make up must be removed before you lay down in bed or you will be fined $40 or something like that. I do not have this issue as I cannot go to bed with any type of make up but for those of you that do, keep this in mind.\nLinen is white and that is what Clorox is for. I just found several things a little too much and absurd. Other than that the area is convenient and it was very CLEAN . I personally will not be staying here again to just avoid the absurd rules in place.', 'Great place to stay. The neighborhood was quiet. Will surely book this location again.', 'If you’re looking for great value in a stay in the Miami area I would recommend this Airbnb. Dan and Michelle are responsive hosts and are looking for guests who respect their home. So if you’re easy going and like value go ahead and book.', 'The rules of chequin and cheq out are extremely extreme you have to enter after 3 and exit wings 11am\nDan is a person who appears to be super friendly and understandable but he is not!!! we asked him please if we could leave a little later than the time of the check out and he said that we also did not ask him if we could leave the luggage outside next to the place or the door of his house since he lives behind to go to lunch before leaving he said that I did not remain silent and I did not say anything today when leaving at 11 am I wrote to him if I could wait for the Uber inside or he had to leave outside he did not answer he left his house personally to argue with me and disrespect me by telling me ridiculous that I was upset and full of anger and we went out arguing it was the worst Airbnb stay of my life I do not recommend it nor will I stay there again', 'The place is perfect! Private and just a tiny ways away from downtown. Everything was clean and easy to manage, and the hosts were very responsive and kind.', 'the unit was very clean and spacious. Dan and his family were very friendly and responsive to our needs. I would definitely recommend staying here', ""Great place to stay for the weekend!

More than recommended, we will be sure to rent again in the future and recommend it with friends and family."", 'Everything was self explanatory and worked out great.

The closet is large enough and bathroom clean (but a bit tiny). The hosts offered a welcome basket with healthy snacks, waters, and basic amenities like unlimited Keurig coffee. They’re are also some convenient moveable coffee tables so you can eat comfortably from your sofa or bed. They also included magazines and local guides. It feels like a little modern resort. The only drawback is the limited ability to sit outside (it seems they’re still working on updating the surrounding lawn).

One, they make it seem like the location is more convenient than it actually is. It’s not walkable to anything except a secluded part of the beach. The building smells like mildew. They blame it on the humidity of Miami but that’s a given so that excuse didn’t make much sense to me. The staff is loud and inconsiderate early in the morning on the weekend. If you’re staying on the first floor, prepare for a loud flood fan and soggy carpet in your room. They offered a humidifier or something along those lines that did nothing to take the moisture out of the room.

It was our first time in Miami Beach, and the pleasant vibes we felt surrounded with were due to the welcoming atmosphere of the modest but cozy, retro-like hotel Venezia, which our room was part of, plus the excellent communication with the hosts all the way through, along with the delicious food and friendly staff of Bon Bouquet Café on the first floor. The building: just 5 minutes away from the beach. Our room: spacious, with a comfy bed, a large TV, a neat bathroom, nice views from the window, and all the necessary amenities. The easy access to the rooftop offered splendid views, too: a perfect spot for taking photos.

The cafe in lobby area staff were super friendly. Visit experience -based on comfortability, I’d give it 3 stars for being okay b/c during the day I was not in unit. For night, I would rate 2 stars. 1- the unit I was in on the 3rd floor the AC unit was extremely loud, I could not hear the TV at the same time AC was on. In addition there was a loud constant humming machinery noise that seemed to be coming from roof top 4th floor. 2-The fire alarm sounded twice during the night. It would have been nice for security or host to inform (i.e call to the units, mass message via platform, email) all guests the status of the ringing alarm. I understand there are things that happens beyond the host(s) control. Again, I admired the location so I would book property again.

Beach supplies, a small office/workspace, comfortable sleeping and sitting space, a coffee maker (she gave me enough coffee for the whole week!), some snacks and drinks. There is a great private patio outside with a table & 4 chairs and it backs up to the canal. I took the canoe out on my last morning and saw a lot of different fish and some iguanas. I did a lot of coming and going and one thing that was really nice was that one of the closest intersections nearby is located at a traffic signal, so it was always easy to make a left turn into the neighborhood if traffic was heavy.

The room was a good size for two people and there was enough space for our stuff as well. It was a bit cold though, but we were able to close the A/C vent. I would still recommend bringing a jacket if you get cold easily. The kitchen nook was small and cute. Connie even provided us with snacks, breakfast items, and drinks! There are two mini fridges, which was perfect to hold our trays of food. There was a lot of open space in the closet, so you can easily hang stuff up. I really liked that there was a desk and mirror in the closet as well. The bathroom is small, but it's still really convenient and we did not have any problems at all.

Here is very secluded little neighborhood where you have to drive most places. Overall it was good and Connie has an abundance of stuff to use if you make rhe trip to the beach."", 'This place only single person. Space too small. Water comes too much slow.

Highly recommend!', 'I enjoy this apartment enough to book it again when I visit Sunrise! The apartment is spacious, clean, and nicely decorated. Even though I’ve never taken advantage of the additional amenities for canoeing or going to the beach, I am impressed that Connie offers “extras” and includes detailed instructions in the guest notebook. Using the Airbnb app for communicating, I am grateful for her very prompt response every time I’ve reached out to her. I enjoy the privacy and the solitude of this accommodation.', 'Connie was wonderful and sweet, but the space was not adequate for an AirBnB and not worth the costs paid. The dishes were plastic and the plates resembled frisbees. Refridgerators were tiny and noisy and we were not expecting the sleeping arrangements we walked into. There was a Futon, a trundle bed, and a day bed. The trundle was on wheels and was not anchored to the day bed, so alot of care was needed to avoid falling from it. The room was noisy because of the AC as well. The description made it seem like there was a separate bedroom, but it was one mid-sized space, and without a kitchenette as described. It was just a counter with the refrigerators and microwave pushed underneath it. We washed the dishes where we brushed our teeth and the water pressure was sometimes down to a trickle. Checking in time of 4PM and out at 10AM was insufficient, but we made it work. Connie would be an awesome host, but the space is not adequate for two much less a family with kids.', 'Super place, roomy and comfortable, very nice shower, great vanity and desk area nook.

Connie was very attentive to make sure that I was comfortable.', ""Connie's Tropical Paradise was perfect for my short stay. The location was in a quiet, safe neighborhood. The home was easy to find, and Connie had a greeting sign in the driveway for me with directions to the entry of my unit. Once at the entry door, my name was posted on the door so there is no confusion on which unit was mine. Connie communicated with me before arrival, during my stay and after checkout to ensure I was pleased with the unit and accommodations. The unit was clean and orderly as described.\nI would absolutely rent Connie's unit again.\nEli"", 'Thanks Connie, nice , clean and safe place', 'This self-sufficient apartment is perfect for one or two people who want the ability to have breakfast “at home” before going about their day.

Connie is an outstanding host and her communication with guests is top tier!', 'Very peaceful surroundings. Located on a small canal and provided with a canoe or kayak. Private patio that faces the canal. The inside of the suite was clean and stocked with essentials and then some. Close to shopping, expressways, etc.\nWe had an issue with our rental car and Connie even offered to provide a complimentary ride to the airport if we needed it. She gave clear instructions throughout our stay and asked several times, (via text), if there was anything else she could do to make our stay more comfortable.\nThe only slight inconvenience is you are asked not to use more than one small appliance at a time. We worked around this and would stay here again.', 'I have stayed at Connie’s twice in a little over a month’s time. Obviously that speaks to how much I enjoy the experience right? I highly recommend you experience the hospitality for yourself.', 'Miss Connie was a superstar! She is so kind and so quick to respond. I wanted to do a very early check in at 4AM and I messaged Miss Connie and she was so welcoming and accommodating. I was also having a bit of problems booking and she kept in contact with me and was so patient until I figured it out.\nThe place looked just like the pictures, and there were super informative books available about shells and other tropical things. There’s a binder for extra information and instructions for appliances that are also very helpful. The beds were so comfortable and cozy we didn’t want to get up or leave. Very cozy and homey. Felt like a home away from home.\nOverall 10/10 trip and BNB. I’m definitely coming back and exploring more in the area.', 'Great stay. Quaint & cute place! Connie was very responsive and came to help us out immediately with a few things we needed! Will def stay again if in the area!

Comfy, cozy, and a little home away from home. Thanks you Arnel and Dunia. We had a great stay.', ""Overall, this was a nice stay. Be aware pics aren't the same as what's on the property outside. Different hammock and the umbrella was not there. The only negative thing I could say is the Rooster wake up calls every morning. Also, the cars that raced up street at night. Hosts will also be on property for a few hours if cleaning other rentals that are on sight, but they were friendly. Saw the black kitty and she is super sweet. Also saw another one that was super sweet. Just wish I had seen water bowls out for the house kitty.

The place was clean and a decent size but the balcony was deceivingly small based on the pictures posted. The kitchen had barely any kitchen supplies...not enough to cook full meals which we had plans to do. And also there was no dish soap to clean the dishes. There weren’t any extra blankets either.\nCheck in was difficult for us because our flight was delayed and we needed family to pick up our key within the time frame allotted. Authorizing someone else to pick up the key was stressful and not as easy as if the check in was with a drop box (or something similar). The bathroom was small and had the only mirror in the entire apartment. The cabinets looked like a dog chewed on them. It just wasn’t in great condition. The lobby was pretty though. Great for a quick stay if you’re going to mostly eat out but the description of a “condo” is a bit deceiving.\nThe pool area was beautiful and the view from our balcony was nice as well.', 'Amazing condo.

I would definitely stay here again in my future visits to Miami and recommend it to others.', 'Great place to stay, just as described in the listing. The bed was big and comfortable and the hotel/apt was clean and spacious. Valet was an easy in/out and reception was easy for check in/out. If you follow the listing’s instructions, you don’t need to even interact with the host.\nFor us, our stay was based on places we wanted to dine at for my husband’s birthday. It was a convenient base for dinner at Crazy About You - a 5 minute walk. We intended to go to the highly-rated brunch at the Four Seasons which was right across the street, but couldn’t get in because they require reservations we didn’t know we needed which was a bummer. We drove to the nearby American Social instead and had a blast eating by the Miami River. Loved our stay here and recommend to anyone looking to stay in the Brickell area.']",['2 guests · 1 bedroom · 1 bed · 1 bath'],https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/47468802?adults=1&children=0&enable_m3_private_room=true&infants=0&pets=0&search_mode=regular_search&check_in=2024-10-27&check_out=2024-11-01&source_impression_id=p3_1729417104_P3cjpIb3Zg8ipk4m&previous_page_section_name=1000&federated_search_id=cb3cdc81-4afe-47eb-a8a4-180d9ccd0093

It was a very good experience!', 'this place has a beautiful, large dog park about 2 blocks away and the back yard looked like it would also be functional for pets (although I didn’t spend the time to ensure the area was inescapable for a small dog). This is a big deal because this part of Miami is difficult to really find a good place for dog walks. There are so few areas of grass for walking and “business,” and it can be hard on dogs who are accustomed to a yard.', 'The pictures don’t do this place justice!

The AC in the bedroom didn’t work well. It was extremely cold and would not adjust to a comfortable temperature. We ended up having to turn it off the second night, but then we were too hot. The nice points were the private backyard for my dog, the location, and the fact that the owner lived right next-door, and was extremely accommodating and friendly.', 'Great stay!

The neighborhood is in walking and biking distance (I loved getting to use the bikes) to great restaurants and high end shopping.

There was a “used” towel hanging on the back of the bathroom door(assuming from previous guests) This place is ideal for two guests not three as the futon is very uncomfortable. Host did explain there was a topper however, it was still extremely uncomfortable. The sheets provided for the futon are very old and low quality. It even had stains on them.

Two big closets with hangers and plenty of space for 2 people. The bathroom was clean and very modern. You get a fridge and a microwave oven, and a coffee maker. To add personal touch, you get tea, some treats and bottled water waiting for you on arrival. Over all, it was a pleasant stay.\nThe host were super nice, friendly and accommodating. Danay was generous enough to allow me to drop off my luggage since I arrived early. I met Robert, nice gentleman, gave me recommendations on places to go and eat. Great source where locals go.\nAfter looking at several options and reviews, my decision to stay with them has not disappointed me. Enjoy what “Little Havana”, the people, the food and the culture has to offer and I wish you great Journey and great resting places like what I’ve experienced with Robert and Danay.

They sent check in and check out instructions. Lovely neighborhood near Calle Ocho which is what I wanted. I asked a couple of questions and only got form letter response. I didn't realized the Airbnb was IN the house and I had to enter the house to gain access. I probably read the instructions wrong- the instructions came via email during the time when I was disembarking from my cruise and navigating all of that insanity of getting an Uber. The little dog greeted me and I loved that! Unexpected, but welcome.\nThe Internet didn't work in the morning and I had heard them leave so I didn't say anything but it left me with no TV or music.\nThe shower head is beautiful but the water doesn't come out of all the tiny nozzles. lol!!!!

They were very quick responders especially when I texted about waiting for the uber. Check in and out was very smooth and the room offered everything that was needed and more. I would for sure book again if I’m ever back there for a cruise. Also, for cruisers, it is not far from the port so definitely a good space to stay if flying in the day before.

You can park inside the property. The location is walkable to Calle Ocho, restaurants, bars, and there you will find local free trolley to Brickell City Centre, and conveniently Uber/Lift back to Calle Ocho.\nRobert was very attentive, and was there to give us recommendations of restaurants, and the surroundings.

They supply lots of bathroom needs such as q-tips, a flat iron, curler, toothpaste etc. I also loved the privet parking they provided so we didn't have to park on the street.

The only downsides were that the tv wasn't working when we got there and the bathroom didn't have a door but that didn't bother us so much as we still had a great time!"", 'Danay and Robert’s house is just a few blocks from Calle Ocho, in Little Havana. We were able to walk down there and tour the area, experience a lot of the local food and nightlife. We walked down the next morning for a great Cuban breakfast with Cuban coffee.

I loved the restaurant they had downstairs as it was very convenient especially in the morning for breakfast. The walk to the beach was literally a block away which I loved. And the location was perfect as there were restaurants, liquor stores, and pharmacies near by. Only 10 minutes from South Beach too!', 'The location was in a good area! Right in walking distance of the beach , restaurants. The room was clean and comfortable. I will definitely stay here again when I come to Miami!', 'Overall a good stay. Very responsive and friendly. The bed was comfortable and the room was nice. AC kept the room very cool and comfort.\nHowever, the chair had a stain on it, and there was no Netflix (false advertising).

The beach is around the corner, the roof top seating areas are awesome, the rooms are clean and $8/24h parking is only a 10 minute walk away.', 'They are taking money without my authorization! I need to dispute $147 dollars they still from my account without me consent!

Super friendly staff and great spot with CitiBikes available to ride everywhere.. But yeah. Extremely musty and damp- left clothes and hair smelling. Staff brought in a dehumidifier which helped but the smell is just everywhere so even though they were willing to change our room I don’t think it would have mattered. If you just are looking for a place to lay your head and be outside most of the time and are on a budget this would be a spot for you if you can handle sleeping in an aquarium and loud AC/dehumidifier going constantly. Staff was really great- just the building is musty and damp.', 'Super cute', 'Excellent in overall.', 'Loved my stay!

The fire alarm went off twice which was very annoying waking me out of my sleep for a false alarm worried about if we were on fire. For a woman traveling alone I wouldn’t recommend it some of the other hotel members gave off bad vibes when trying to warm up my food downstairs in the microwave(which is annoying having to go to the lobby to use the microwave) after hotel Clarks are gone. I wouldn’t stay again unless I was accompanied by others. Other than that everything was great ! There’s lots of restaurants, a lot of things to do that are close and a great scenery, loved that the beach was a 3 min walk not even!

The first morning we were waken up at 7am by very loud music as our room was directly above the cafe. We asked to be moved to another room and the host was truly amazing - they moved us immediately even though it was late afternoon. Unfortunately we then had very loud and aggressive neighbors, we messaged the host which intervened immediately (at 2am!) and eventually the things got better. However, both rooms had an unpleasant sewage/dampness smell, the tv remote in the first room didn’t work, AC was loud, and the furniture in both was quite worn out.

The host was exceptional - extremely responsive, friendly, and accommodating. I felt completely safe and at ease throughout my visit.

I'm already looking forward to my next visit! Thank you again for a fantastic experience."", ""This is a great find for a stay so close to the beach. It is up north too so if you want extra quiet at the beach all you do is walk two blocks and you're there. The unit is small but good for a few days. The only issues we had was the noises of people slamming doors and such, things you can't really control. Otherwise this place is a great."", 'Only a block back from the beach for a fraction of the price.

My cons of this place: AC has to be turned off if you are gone longer than 3 hours. (I find this odd because it is humid/hot in Florida, and to have to come back to a hot room was frustrating) However, when we turned the AC back on it would get cool in the room quick. Another con was the restroom door is see-through. My partner and I enjoy our privacy when in the restroom and it was frustrating having to step out of the Airbnb each time either of us occupied the restroom to give each-other space. You can hear every little noise in the restroom as it is a small space to the room. You can also see every movement someone is doing in the restroom (handling business on the toilet). Other than that, I enjoyed the amenities and free parking. I would stay here again if I was by myself. Quiet neighborhood, quick access to hwy and stores nearby!

This is one of my favorite stays', 'Place was just like pictures. Clean, area was quiet. Had everything needed. I stayed for almost a week and felt right at home. Will definitely book again. I am very picky and hard to find comfort somewhere else besides home so I just washed the linens (washer and dryer in unit which i loved) and brought my own cleaning spray to reassure myself although it looked clean already. You won’t be disappointed.', 'Place was excellent and as described to a T in the listing. Host was helpful and responsive in a timely manner. This place is definitely reasonably priced for the quality and I would stay here again!', 'I came back on one of my first days of my month staying at this airbnb to the place filled with bugs all over the house. They were flying ants and roaches… I told the host about it the inconvenient situation and host said she was going to do something about it by contacting an exterminator. The host then proceeded to ignore all my text messages and a buddy of mine who contacted as well. I did not hear back until the day after the stay was complete. A whole month after.. by them to say “sorry i just seen this” on my check out day after my 30 day stay.. I took multiple videos of the bug infestation and it felt miserable not being able to even shower and sleep in peace. This along with a wobbly table that has a loose leg, almost caused a few accidents when preparing dinner for visitor.', 'Was a great place to stay, clean, the air works good, not to far from Miami Beach and she responded very quickly I give it a 10/10!', 'Amazing space and convenient location', ""Veronica's place is very comfortable, all as advertised. Good location, downtown and accessible. It will definitely be our new lodging option every time we return to Miami. Veronica was always very attentive to all the questions, super host!"", 'I stayed here for about a month. Overall the place is as advertised, the host was very responsive and helpful, and the inside of the place is very comfortable and nice. The internet was not working when I arrived but the host quickly got it fixed. Staying here as a young woman by myself, I felt a little uncomfortable in the area/neighborhood that the place is located, it wasn’t very walkable, and it was pretty loud outside at night on the weekends. There is a gate in the driveway that is not locked and has to be manually opened when driving in and out, so you have to get out of the car to open the gate before you pull in and to close the gate after you pull in. Not ideal to have to get out of your car on the street if you are alone and coming/going frequently, especially late at night. Bathroom had a broken towel rack and a shower curtain that didn’t stay closed very well. Overall it was an adequate place to stay for the month I was there.', 'Me and my wife were glad to find this place with such a great price in a good location in Miami. We felt safe, and with privacy, clean and neat, and there was parking available. Veronica was super helpful and kind in communicating. I really recommend this place!!', ""Great place very new and clean. Comes with everything you'll need for a great stay. Got your own little house separated from any other buildings."", 'Not bad, not great either; on the brighter side, I do love how there is a private parking spot included, washer & dryer available, panini press & air fryer included in kitchen. Bed is very comfortable too but more blankets would have been nice.\nThere was no hand soap provided & only 3 in 1 mens wash in the shower. plus the towel rack kept falling off the wall & making disturbances throughout the day. It took all day to send over door entry code having me stressing on the phone with airbnb. Overall it was a okay for a couple days, but I would not recommend staying any longer', 'Great little place. Plenty of AC (which is great for the FL heat). Responds promptly. Would have loved a coffee maker though.', 'We stayed March 16-21, 2024 Veronica’s place was just as listed. It was very cozy and comfortable. Felt just like home. It could use more shelving space for luggage and something in shower to hold soap and shampoo but other than that the place was very clean and Veronica was a very nice and friendly host. She is very responsive and made sure everything was okay. The price was good. For a studio apartment that is what it is but was enough room for 2 adults.', ""Veronica's place was above and beyond my expectations, very convient, close to lots of restaurant and beaches ⛱️, this is the 3rd air and been I have been to in miami and by far the best place and and best prices to match,Ilike that fact the prices where not outrageous for tourist like me,I felt at home lots of good lighting and natural sunlight which is very important for my mental health,this place is perfect for a small family and couples, I fly back n forth to miami a lot for business, I found my new home,I will be booking with her as far as she has availability,do not hesitate to book this place you won't be disappointed!!"", 'Veronica’s place was nice and clean! Gated, which made us feel safe.', 'Wasn’t expecting anything fancy or extravagant due to the location/ price. Upon arrival the place is quiet and cozy but unfortunately was left un cleaned from the prior guest. The bed looked as if it had not been washed and wasn’t made. Used towels were left on the ground. Trash from previous guest was left all over kitchen counter. Only half a toilet paper roll was provided. I had to inconvenience myself to go to the super market to buy laundry detergent and toilet paper and wash the bedding and towels myself. Contacted host several times with my concerns with no reply. Stayed 2 nights and didn’t get a reply until 5 hours after I was already checked out. The only good thing I have to say is Location is a great spot to easily access Wynwood and downtown Miami area. Only 6-15 drive.', 'Great experience', 'Place is cute and cozy, just not the greatest of neighborhoods but otherwise still an extremely nice spot if you need a place to stay near miami or wynwood for that matter. Veronica was an excellent host and fast to respond and the place was clean, private and comfortable. Would definitely stay again.', 'Very cozy and comfortable. I liked the enclosed parking. Made me feel safe. I also made use of the washer and dryer which was convenient.

Wish there was a bit more storage in bathroom. An extension cord for power and some room spray would be handy. The place provided peace of mind though the street is not as reflective of the cleanliness of the room.', ""I had a lovely stay at Veronica's! The apartment was niquel! The host was very responsive, barely sent a response already! Veronica was able to reassure me when needed! Nothing to say! I think the only small downside would be that the fridge makes some noise from time to time and the blinds in the room that lets in all the daylight so for the night it's not great but I think it's typically American!! Otherwise it was perfect! Thanks again"", 'Everything looked exactly like the pictures! A little more spacious than I imagined.

It was a nice getaway for a mom of 3. I am someone who enjoys the art district and everything was close by. There was space if I needed to park. And when I needed to relax it was nice and quiet.

Communication with the host was quick and effective, which made everything easier. I would recommend this place without hesitation!”', ""The fundamentals here are very good. I was looking for an inexpensive place to stay relatively close to downtown, and Veronica’s place delivers. The neighborhood was fine, and the gate, setting, etc made me feel like the place private and safe. If you’re looking for an inexpensive place to stay, this is hard to beat.\nThe reason I deducted a start though is that there are lots of unforced errors that could have been easily and inexpensively fixed. There was no soap or shampoo. Both hand and shower towels were hidden and hard to find (annoying when you arrive needing to go to the bathroom!). There is no dishwasher (which is totally fine), but there js also no drying rack, which would be so easy to fix. when you go buy soap, there's no (non-broken) place to put the soap in the shower besides the ground. Finally, the towel rack is broken.\nYou'll be fine if you stay here, but prepare for lots of minor annoyances!"", 'Quiet neighbourhood. Not the best zone but We feel safe.\nThe apartment is as described. All recently renovated with all the things you need to have a great stay.', 'Very nice and clean place.

It was tucked away and away from the main road and quiet. It was very clean and comfortable.\nIt had everything I needed. Unfortunately, when looking for places in this area not every place has an in-unit washer and dryer so it was a nice touch in Veronica’s spot. It made my month long stay nice to not have to visit a laundromat.\nMy only complaints are that the towel rack was not well fitted into the wall and would fall out if touched with minor contact. Also the shower curtain did not stay closed and would allow for water to get out on the floor.\nOverall I had a very pleasant stay.', 'Great place to stay! Really complete unit, clean and secure with parking and AC, will be a pleasure to stay there again.', 'The space is a perfect place for those that are staying short term and need a safe, comfortable place to rest and relax.

Thank you!', 'The place has everything you need. Recommended', 'I think it’s a great place if you need a cheap, smaller place to stay in Miami. Hosts were nice, place was decent, minus a few things.\nFirst, there is construction/renovation ongoing in the duplex next to the location — if you’re planning on sleeping in, forget about it. Second, ants in the bathroom. Lots of them. I was busy with helping with by best friends wedding, so I didn’t want to deal with it. Third, there is a strong mildew smell that permeates your clothes even when you go home, so be prepared to wash everything with some white vinegar and detergent when you get back home. If they invest in some scent and moisture absorbers it might help. These things are fixable, so I would still recommend this to people whose needs match with this place.\nUltimately it was a decent stay, will probably do a hotel next time however. This wasn’t a good match for me in the end, but would definitely be a good match for some other people.', ""super clean and quiet place. small tidy place I would describe it like a master bedroom (I stayed by myself, I recommend no more than 2 ppl due to space)with a large bathroom and you got your corner with everything you need kitchenette, sink,micro, mini fridge,stove top and washer/dryer.

Secondly, I fell in love with the place; it was perfect and had everything we needed and more. I had brought my beach chairs, but he even had some along with beach towels. The location is fantastic—walking distance to the beach, around the corner from a Venezuelan bakery you can’t miss, a Cuban place for coffee and a delicious Cuban sandwich, and an Argentine restaurant for dinner. All of this is within two blocks, not to mention the convenience store and Walgreens also nearby. I truly enjoyed my stay and hope to be back soon!

It is peaceful and much quieter as compared to many of the other touristy and overcrowded areas of Miami Beach.\nFree parking right in front of the condo is fairly easy to find from 8am until 4pm, but more challenging after that.

Firstly the place needs a genuine renovation. Most of the floor tiles are coming off and it felt so weird. There were water leaks from the roof and strange water drop sounds throughout my stay. The bathroom looks very creepy and it was very unhygienic to see random bottles of shampoo and body wash used by someone else on all the counters. I was deeply disappointed with this. The projector remote stopped working abruptly and entertainment was limited after that. What is not shown in the pictures is how poor the building really is. There is construction happening loudly on the 17th floor and was very disturbing. This is not at all worth the $ I paid. The response of the host was inadequate too', 'The unit looks exactly like the photos! I loved the view, the bed, pole, and hot tub. I also loved that there was an ice machine in there which was very thoughtful. I had to reach out to Joshua for a few things and he was super responsive. When my bf and I first walked in, the unit was a bit warm to us and Joshua quickly lowered the temperature of the AC after I reached out. We had lots of fun in the unit. There was one issue the following morning. The tub had a leak overnight and there was water that ended up all over the floor surrounding it. I notified Joshua of it.

We saw a guy next door on the right side of the building sitting down on his phone and when we asked if he was valet employee he said no and went back in his phone maybe he was lying maybe not.

Once parked, arrived in the unit to find leftover trash. While unpacking, a complete stranger entered the LOCKED unit, startling me, mumbled some words and quickly walked out. Noticed cabinets falling apart. The unit was not in good shape. Terrible water pressure, almost unable to take a shower. The balcony was not even large enough to stand outside on. To top everything off, I left one bag behind and immediately notified the host who was absolutely NO help and had zero empathy. I could have very easily walked back to the room to retrieve it but was unable to. Many sentimental items missing. Waited in Miami all afternoon waiting to hear back only to get a response that the guests did not find anything leftover. Terrible experience overall.', 'I really enjoyed staying there. Truth is I got there very late due to plane delays , will probably stay again and stay longer. Thank you', 'Great host, very responsive if you have any questions.

We used the washer and dryer at the property to clean them ourselves for peace of mind. I'll be bringing my own towels to AirBnBs from here on out.

The walls of the motel (the location seems to be a renovated motel) are very thin and you can hear a pin drop. Traffic can be loud being right on biscayne blvd. There’s seating arrangements set up as “communal” seating, however the outside area needs to be cleaned. There is a lot of furniture and wardrobes which doesn’t make it inviting / is messy. This is in the lounge areas where everyone must pass through... There is no comfortable place to sit outside, they have a wooden bench in the back parking lot, however it is often dirty and not cleaned.
