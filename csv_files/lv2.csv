Nice to get away from the noice and lights. Found necessities were missing - bath soap, dishwasher tabs, dish cloth, dish towels which would have made cleaning up easier.', 'Awesome stay with Manny! He is very helpful and makes it easy to check in. I hope we can stay with him in the future. Also the place is very nice and clean! The bed is very comfortable and i could of slept on it all day!', 'Great location and great spot! The whole condo is quite and safe. The pool area and the gym saved my life! Happy overall and felt comfortable during my stay. Probably I will come back.\nManny so actively responding and helping.', 'Manny we thank you for making us feel right at home we had everything here at the house with everything within 5 minutes at our disposal, we can‚Äôt wait to continue to use this our new home thank you again Manny!', 'The place was fantastic! Exactly as described and perfect for what we needed.

We had a great stay. Thanks, Manny!', 'Highly recommend very modern cute place. Everything you need is at your fingertips. Manny was very responsive and pleasant. 3 casino‚Äôs within walking distance and Walgreens on the corner for your convenience 2 beautiful pools when weather permits opening. We also appreciated the security thru out. You won‚Äôt be disappointed renting from Manny', 'I could not figure out where to go / how to exit if my daughter did not pick me up.\nWould have liked to go to casino one day but other reviews said it was not safe to walk.\nTowels were arranged attractively on bed and in bathroom.\nBlankets for relaxing on couch would be helpful. I used a sheet at night to watch tv.\nEnjoyed patio to have coffee.\nBed very comfy - hard for short person to get into.\nPerfect for one person, maybe two.\nWould be helpful to have coffee supply, sweetener choices, and creamer as many other air b and b‚Äôs do.\nIf I had not bought some protein shakes to drink and packets of coffee, pouches of tuna I would have been very hungry. I did not know where to go. It is not the hosts fault- just a heads up for future guests like me who don‚Äôt drive or know their way around. There were no neighbors to ask that I saw. Winter time?', 'Everything matched the photos, a nice place. A little noise from the upstairs apartment, but it was only the last day.', ""I would have given it 4.5 stars if that was possible. It was a good place. It will be better once they build next door and there's not an empty lot with trash and an occasional homeless person walking around. I felt safe in our complex but security needs to keep an eye on the gate. The screen door to the porch was broken but everything else was in pretty good order. I would definitely consider staying here again."", 'Great location! We did have an issue with the condo not being clean upon check-in, but Manny sent out a housekeeper to take care of it. However, covid cleaning protocol was not followed. Other than that it was a great stay. Rules are posted everywhere. Security at the front was a plus.', 'Manny is real good host. His response time might not be the quickest though. But he seems to be quick to resolve\nany situation. There was a couple of issues that were really non issues for me. Just wanted to bring them to to his attention and he quickly offered to fix it.\nManny‚Äôs place is clean and quiet.', 'All I can say is\nI will be back', 'Apparently nice and functional, very comfortable bed.\nA little far from the strip on foot especially in the evening , passing the regular train at night .', 'Location was amazing!

What a wonderful stay in Vegas, definitely recommend', 'Thank you, appreciate it everything.', 'Straight forward, nothing special.', 'A great clean quiet place at an affordable price. We were visiting Vegas with a toddler so went for an airbnb, and could not imagine we would land on this hidden gem. Manny was very courteous from the very beginning let us in an hour in advance than our check-in time since we arrived early. Everything else was very systematic with security in place and a gated community. There was pool, hot tub & gym for additional leisure which we did not end up using. We will definitely stay here again.', ""Manny and his Flamingo Palms condo was just as described. Manny had clear and easy communication with good response. The condo was extremely clean, good location to the strip, UNLV, and the I15 for easy travel. The condo complex included a security gate with guards, and a nice pool and fitness center that I utilized most days. Highly recommended and wouldn't hesitate renting again!"", 'Manny was a great host, and the place was exactly as advertised. Great lil spot close to the strip.

And gave great information before arriving.', 'My stay was good! The location is close to the airport, and the Las Vegas strip. All of the amenities listed were available. Manny communicated well and responded timely. The only downsides were the extra pillows in the closet had hair on them, and the placemats on the kitchen table were dirty.', ""Manny's place was clean except for a few towels, and a little amount of trash left behind. The house cleaner forgot to tackle the Air BNB before we arrived. We left to grab something to eat, no big deal. When we returned, everything was very clean. We did use Uber at least twice a day.

Clean and comfortable and close to the strip and the pools here are beautiful!', ""Manny has a super nice apartment with everything you need. You also have lots of space. It's easy to park.

The neighbors seemed quiet and everyone kept to themselves. The pools are nice. The community has what seemed to be 24 hour security which made me feel safe.', 'Lindo apartamento. Pictures honor the reality.', 'Great Location and great value!', 'This is a good place if you want to stay off the strip! The area it‚Äôs in is safe, but to get to and from the strip or anywhere else you‚Äôll definitely want to drive because the areas between the apartment and there are less than safe. There‚Äôs a light outside the bedroom window but blackout curtains that almost keep it out. The bathtub is huge but the shower head is just dated. It‚Äôs got everything you need though! Especially if you want to stay for a bit and do laundry, or if you come and it‚Äôs warmer and you want to use the pool.

Apart from the dust and trash great. üëçüèº"", ""Manny's place was great. Just around the corner from the strip, clean, secure, easy in and out, and quiet.

Host responds very quick to any questions or concerns.\nHighly recommend', 'It was nice that the apartment building has a separate entrance so you don‚Äôt have to enter through casino every time. Clean and quiet. But just a short walk through indoor bridge to get to casino and restaurants.\nWe enjoyed staying off the strip. The goal of this trip was to visit state and national parks that are close. Red rock state park is only 30 min away from location.', ""Michael's place was great just what we wanted. Nice and private not so busy like the strip and SO reasonable in price.\nA.Y.C.E buffet was delicious pricey but worth it. You will find that nextdoor at Palms Casino. You will stay at Palms Place which is connected via indoor walkway and will take you to Palms Casino where you will find several restaurants, bars, slot machines a movie theater and mini food court.\nYou wouldnt want to walk to the strip it would be a LONG walk but it's very easy to get to via Uber. Ask the valet parking person where to find the rideshare waiting area and your set.\nTheres a corner store across the way, a walgreens down the block and Sonic and Chick-Fil-A right nearby. Personally wouldn't recommend the BBQ restaurant in the Casino it was not good and unreasonably priced\nMichael's place was fairly clean there was glitter all over from the people before I'm assuming but that's minor the bathtub wasnt very clean but so relaxing after the strip. Stay here!"", 'overall experience is good, though the check in process is a bit delayed due to lack of check in code.', 'The apartment looked super nice and all but when we arrived a lot was dirty. There were hairs in the bath tub, on the bed and under the sheets. The floor had not been cleaned in a long time as it turned a towel brown after wiping some water that dripped on the floor. The head of the bed seemed to be falling apart, the utensils like the knife and such provided for the kitchen were more dull than a credit card. I do really like this Airbnb for its location, however I was a bit shocked by how carelessly someone must have cleaned the room if at all. The Airbnb stated a minibar which we didn‚Äôt seem to have in our room either. Don‚Äôt get me wrong this is a great location, and peaceful and quiet compared to the strip.

I will book Michael‚Äôs place again in the future.', 'This place came off really luxurious online, however, it‚Äôs a motel in disguise. Immediate reaction was the chemical and sewer smell. The headboard was ripped and stained, the bathroom light buttons are broken, the hotel phone kept ringing throughout the night, the view was alright, the shower smelt like sewage to us, and the pull out couch was very dirty. Overall, staying there for the couple of nights was fine even considered finding somewhere else last minute. The energy and vibes were not it as we were very excited for Las Vegas. In the end, it was highly talked about online but didn‚Äôt really give all that.', 'I enjoy myself had a great in a nice comfortable room .', 'Loved the place, perfect for my boyfriend and I. Definitely worth the price and Michael responds quick if you need anything. I would 100% stay here again.', ""The place is beautiful, with stainless steel, glass, and marble. Plenty of great amenities in the facilities. Close enough to the Strip, but not too close. Some opportunities for improvement:\n1. Clearer check-in instructions (to help distinguish between casino and hotel check in)\n2. Bed headboard is deteriorating, which is off-putting.\n3. Gorgeous bathroom, but tub stopper doesn't work and spa jets don't work.\n4. Two TVs, but we couldn't get one to even turn on. Maybe needs new batteries in remote.

There was paint peeling off the wall, tiles chipped, and the unit is over all dated and appears not to have had any love given to it in a while. I understand this is a lesser priced condo in Vegas, this specific unit was not terrible, it did not hurt our trip or anything, it was just a little disappointing the condition it was in. The location and facility is good. I have stayed in this exact same type of room at the Palms Place before and this specific unit was the exact same furnishings etc. just not in as good shape.\nAgain, Michael was an excellent host but the unit was ok, probably a little over prided do to the lack of maintenance but not to bad.

The check-in was very seamless and the space was very spacious.', 'Was a great stay and the hotel was great the staff was very friendly and nice.', 'Awesome', 'Very clean, and met expectations.', 'Great room at the Palms Place. Worth the money and close to the strip', 'We had an excellent time staying here and would definitely recommend it to a friend. While it was a little tricky to find, the condo looked just like the pictures, and the shower was amazing. The hotel staff was helpful and kind, and the gym was a nice bonus.\nOne area for improvement is the lighting, which could be brighter. I‚Äôd also suggest a more common coffee maker, like a Keurig, though they did provide coffee for the machine they had. Michael was an excellent communicator and solved any issues quickly. Overall, a fantastic stay!‚Äù', 'I really enjoyed my stay here. Place was comfortable and amenities were great. A huge plus was being close to Palms casino. I would definitely stay here again.', 'Easy access to the strip. About 7-10 minute drive. The Palms however has everything to offer. The unit is great value for the cost. Had a slight problem w toilet but building maintenance responded promptly and fixed the problem.', 'We have stayed at Palms Place before, with a different host, so we kind of had an expectation going in to this stay with Michael. Compared to the other room we stayed in last time, this room is not kept as nice. The knob in the shower is hanging on for dear life, the drain plug in the bathtub didn‚Äôt even block the drain so we couldn‚Äôt use the bath, and the headboard above the bed is tattered. I wasn‚Äôt sure if we were staying in Palms Place or a motel down the street to be honest. Everything else was fine, we didn‚Äôt use the pull out bed in the couch, so I can‚Äôt comment about that at all. With a little bit of love and maintenance put into this unit, it can easily match the luxury that we experienced in our other stay at Palms Place.', 'This place was beautiful and Michael was really helpful. We arrived a little earlier and we were tired and exhausted. I asked the front desk if we could check-in early but they needed approval. Michael jumped on it and got us in. We were able to sit back and relax. The place was huge and the bathroom, kitchen, shower and living area were perfect.

We ran into a little issue at check in with the hotel and housekeeping but Michael took care of it. Now the housekeeping itself wasn‚Äôt its best. The place wasn‚Äôt clean fully. We saw things that should‚Äôve been picked/cleaned up before we checked in. It being a busy weekend for the hotel, I took that into consideration. No negative review, just a thought you should keep in mind when staying in places like this on busy weekends. But i‚Äôm very thankful Michael solved one of our issues. I would recommend since he looks after people that book with him!', 'The place was amazing. The view was amazing at night. Everything was great. Will be back to visit soon.

It's a little dated, but we enjoyed our stay and would stay again."", 'Check in instructions: show ID to front desk to be let in. Expect to leave a card on file plus deposit with the hotel. I didn‚Äôt understand this since we rented thru a private party on airbnb. The hotel makes you do this but don‚Äôt allow you to use any of the Amenities because the unit is a private rental. $5 per towel just to give example.\nOnce entering inside the unit I begin to notice the place wasn‚Äôt completely clean, floors and windows were extremely dirty some of the furniture is worn and extremely damaged. I immediately reached out to Micheal and he was helpful and offered to send housekeeping back. He went the extra mile to make up for that. Sitting on bathroom toilet you can hear the elevator early in the morning. Honestly the unit sleeping area gives rundown motel vibes. The location is great especially if you‚Äôre attending an event at the casino. Walk thru the hallways and you‚Äôre there.', 'Perfect location, clean, and comfortable. Would definitely stay here again! Thank you', 'The location is great. Just off the strip so you can get some peace and quiet and quality sleep. The only thing is suggest is more lighting. You have to open the curtains to get light which allows heat in as well. Other than that I would definitely recommend this place.', ""Michael was great but the building had some issues. Specifically the elevators. It was at least a 5 minute wait every time we needed one. And if you wanted an elevator during checkout we waited 20 minutes before we had to ride one up to get on. Then it was completely full the whole way down. Then on our checkout the elevators were down so we had to carry everything down 11 flights of stairs. The hotel just said ya we know. But again Micheal was great but the building wasn't as solid"", 'Great place and great amenities. Everything to do right on site.

Be careful when booking this listing! Everything was super basic and plastic. Nothing luxury or nice. Main entrance is also very inconvenient. Very highly disappointed!', 'Great place to stay. I would highly recommend', 'Taylor‚Äôs place was great! It was spotless & very spacious! Close to the strip and everything we wanted to do! Would definitely stay here again.', 'U get what u pay for. Probably 500 apartments in the neighborhood and if u come in at night u can‚Äôt see the bldg nr or parking place number. I suggested using fluorescent paint but Taylor‚Äôs sidekick informed me they don‚Äôt own the bldg. So u go ask them if u can pay to paint the bldg nr. As a rental property owner I would be receptive to that offer. When ur getting ready to leave they send very threatening texts of what‚Äôs going to happen if u don‚Äôt do this or that. Place is clean. Taylor was very nice but her sidekick could use some lessons in courtesy. I‚Äôd still recommend this place.', 'This place is located well but will not make you feel at home. It looks good on pictures, but dinner table and chairs are really shabby, chairs have stained seats. Worst, not a single glass, cup, plate or dinner cutlery is available. Only the cheap plastic cutlery that breaks easily and a handful of the styrofoam bowls and paper plates are there. On request I was told that they only provide supplies for the first few days. (Why is there a dishwasher??), also, way too many rules on what cannot be done. You are trapped there on the inside, as no pedestrian access code is given for the locked gate and there is a fine if you ask the management. However, you can go in and out with the car at anytime. Not bad, but I wouldn‚Äôt go back to stay there.', 'Pros: Very large, good to find and still nice and close to the casions. At night it is also quiet outside and you feel quite safe despite the thin entrance door. Providers respond to all emails very quickly and promptly resolve issues.\nNegative: All furniture in the living area was either scratched and damaged or stained (all chairs at the dining table!). The outlets of the air conditioner were all (!) completely dusty (there was 2x a cleaning team to clean). In the kitchen, the paint is already off. The parking costs extra, but you only learn that after booking. From the neighbor you can hear every step and the conditioning is very noisy. All faucets are old and spacky. The welcome email is a list of all the things you are not allowed to do and what penalty payment you get for it - very least.\nConclusion: Some color, a few modern furniture and skillful photos long not to overlook the fact that an old apartment was quickly cleaned up to make money.', '1 week business trip. Quiet, comfortable for work. Not the closest to the Strip but that was intentional. Very good communication with the host. If you are looking for a quiet place in LV, this place would certainly serve the goal.', 'Super clean. Had some trouble finding the apartment as the numbers were right at the door and we didnt want to be snooping on everyone‚Äôs door. Come the find out the apartment was right in front of our designated parking. Overall my guests and I enjoyed our stay.', 'The location was a short distance from groceries, dining, fun, and the Las Vegas strip. The hosts answered any questions I had almost immediately and were super thorough in communication and expectations. Great place to stay, super clean!', 'Everything was great! Very clear and civilized approach to clients. Thank you!', 'Would definitely come back here to stay next time we are in Vegas!', ""It was hard to find, but it's not the host's fault, but the more the arrangement of the blocks and the scan of the apartment blocks that is randomly done, it looks like.\nOtherwise nothing to say, very spacious, clean."", 'The apartment was perfect for our trip and was close enough to the strip and other amenities that it was a quick drive. The only negatives would be that it wasn‚Äôt listed that there would be an addition $10 charger per day for parking. Also there were a lot of potential penalties if certain rules were broken but I feel like this is just being a good guest so it was no problem for us.\nOtherwise great for our stay and we would book with the lister again.', 'We liked the location and the apartment, we have been in several places and I never touch you before that for everything you would like to charge, if you were very attentive to everything that was presented in our stay but also messages that we considered could be omitted, there were no bags for the garbage and you had to leave clean or you would be charged extra in addition to what is already paid in the fee, there were only two rolls of paper for an apartment that receives up to 6 guests, when we rent a place we are always aware that it is not ours and must be taken care of, on this occasion we felt super pressured by so much rule and we were almost not in the place. Overall good, only if there should be a little flexibility and avoid so many messages during the stay so that we can make the guest feel more comfortable unless something is necessary', 'It was as described and was close the convention center making Ubers reasonable! Good for the price.', 'When booking through the app, we enjoyed the location‚Äôs proximity to the strip and other activities. However, it was difficult to enjoy the home because the host continually sent messages about potential upcharges. The rules were already posted in the home, and if you don‚Äôt follow them closely, you risk additional charges. This over-communication was annoying and made it hard to relax. Additionally, there were barely any supplies, such as toilet paper and soap, to the point where we had to purchase necessities for daily use.', 'This is a quiet spot not far from the strip. It was perfect for us as we enjoyed getting out to do all the natural fun that Nevada and the surrounding area has to offer- like the Hoover dam is only around 30 minutes away! The strip is easy to get to and navigate (there is some free parking if you look for it - Venetian for us). We felt super safe in the quiet gated complex and there was plenty of healthy food options nearby.', 'great spot. close to the strip.', ""Had an okay time but wouldn't stay here again because of the hidden fees and bare bones quality.\nPros: Location was great. 15 mins to the strip. Felt safe inside the gated community. Air condition was reliable.\nCons: Listing details are misleading. The listing says fits 6 guests, but there's only 2 bedrooms. You can request an air mattress, which will cost you $20. In my opinion, the air mattress should be included since the listing says you can have 6 guests.\nThe amenities list was also misleading. It said they have a coffee maker (Keurig) and coffee. They even have a photo of the Keurig with coffee pods. But you actually have to click the photo to reveal the caption that says they DON'T include coffee pods. Same with kitchen basics, the hidden photo caption says disposables only.\nParking says it's paid, but they only tell you after booking that it's $10/day/car.\nIf you wanted to check in early, that's also $75.\nDefinitely read all the reviews to know what you're in for."", 'Apartment is fine, close to the strip, clean, everything is basic. Some unsupervised kids threw rocks at our car in the parking lot, other than that, the neighbourhood is fine. There is parking available onsite that is free, it‚Äôs not right in front of the apartment, but the host didn‚Äôt tell us that, they went straight to upcharging for it.', 'Unexpected fees for parking. I did not see anywhere on the listing, nor was it listed in the original prices the fee for parking. The day before check-in, the host informed me that each parking space was an additional $10 per night and we needed two spaces, so I paid an additional $180. that was not expected! Also, the supplies were woefully insufficient! There was one-half roll of toilet paper per bathroom, absolutely no wash clothes, one towel per person, paper plates were paper thin, plastic silverware, a roll of cheap paper towels. Though we did not have the time to go shopping for these items, we were forced to because the host refused to supply any other supplies. The location was perfect for getting to the places we needed to go. FYI, I have never given less than 5 stars to an Airbnb, but I cannot give this host 5 stars. If I had read a review such as this, I would have either just kept looking, or would have been more prepared and brought some of those missing items with me!!!', 'Very good service, nice place near the strip. The apartment is very good.', 'Roku in every room, quite and peaceful complex. I would and do live in a place very similar. Everything is as advertised and more.', 'Everything was great! The location is perfect close to restaurants and walking distance from them!', 'Great value. Warm and cozy and very clean. We felt safe in a unfamiliar location. I would highly recommend.', 'The reviews say there are a lot of rules, and there were lots and lots of additional charges if you defy the rule. We found the spot and the house to be accommodating. There was a library right across the street for the kids and a liquor store for the adults. Loved that lol! It‚Äôs much bigger than the pictures look. It has a huge walk-in closet and a large bathtub. Very nice to relax it after the 108* day. Thank you for hosting us.', 'Our stay in Vegas was great! Super quaint little condo JUST off the beaten path so super walkable or ride share friendly that won‚Äôt completely break the bank. Parking was steps away from the unit which made checking in a literal breeze!', ""over all it was a nice stay, place is nice. but we're asked to be quiet at all time s and people on top we're very load. would be cool to use the pool and gym. there is over flow parking so the charge for parking was not necessary. place was nice and clean. if ur just wanting a place to sleep while u have fun in the strip it's great. thank you for letting us stay with y'all and hope to come back soon. we have a wedding in October lol\nwhen"", 'My friend and I really enjoyed our stay here. The place is super cute and in a gated community. Was very clean and spacious for 2 people. As stated, there only is disposable silverware etc so only thing I would recommend is to bring more of your own paper plates etc before coming if you plan to cook and have more than 1 or 2 people coming!', ""Taylor's place is located within a apartment/condo project. I found the space numbers and the place hard to find in the dark. Once located, access was easy, sneezy. The apartment was neat and clean. There was only plastic utensils and things were on the minimalist side. I was attending a conference, so being away from the strip and the crowds was a welcome relief. There are some rules to follow, but I guess that is to be expected when you're in a complex like that. Overall. I slept well!"", 'Wonderful stay. Would definitely stay again', 'Really comfortable and quiet', 'We enjoyed our stay! Very convenient location and safe neighborhood. Apartment was very clean and cozy! Honestly, plastic silverware feels extremely weird and uncomfortable - especially the availability was absolutely limited and definitely not enough. Only one laundry detergent pod provided‚Ä¶ not sure how the guests are supposed to use one pod while apartment allows max 6 people to stay. We were 3 of us and one pod was definitely not enough. Overall, good stay and very convenient location. Close to Allegiant stadium and the strip!', 'Accommodation was great size and very clean. Easy check in and out.

The unit was much more spacious than we expected, and Taylor was a great host. The bathroom supplies she left were especially useful.

I am a teacher and I‚Äôve been teaching for 27 years and I understand what it means to have rules. Believe me , your rules are excessive simply too many .

Space was clean, easy to check into, and surrounded by great restaurants."", 'Carol was a really good host to answer most of my mails. The apartment was fine except all flying moths in the nighttime.\nThe pool area and staff there was amazing. We met so many wonderful people and are very happy for that.\nBut we find it difficult to know that all our 10 nights was disturbed by this awful moths. They did land on us, crawled in our hairs and bed, yes they were awful.\nWe got a compensation of 100 US dollars while we paid over 1800 . It is way too little compensation for 10 nights with just a few hours sleep and needing to take care of flying moths!!!\nBest regards Christin Watson\n22 floor apartment 308', 'Pleasant stay quiet and peaceful', 'Great location and great facilities', 'Thank Yu so much for hosting my stay.

The next day I noticed a long line just after 4 pm, so it might be good to see about early check-in or arrive a bit later to avoid the wait.\nUber was $11 each way to the strip and was quick.\nInstructions from the listing were detailed and pretty much answered any questions, so I didn‚Äôt have a need to communicate with the host.\nHere are the reasons I gave four stars instead of five: Free WiFi was limited to one device. The first elevator on the left was problematic because the card reader didn‚Äôt work; not the host‚Äôs fault, but a negative nonetheless. The view is nice but the windows are absolutely filthy.\nWould have been nice to have a couple of water bottles in the fridge.\nOverall, an OK deal for a couple of nights.', 'Place was beautiful. Very nice strip view', 'Great place & great host!', 'We loved staying at this hotel! It was a nice spot and lovely room!', 'Amazing stay! Very clean and very nice place. We had really nice views of the strip. Just as a heads up if you‚Äôre looking for a balcony, this particular room doesn‚Äôt have one.

Check-in was straightforward, the best was comfortable, and the location was safe and convenient for food, casino, and other options.', 'The room is really nice! I loved having a kitchen in the place, and the bathroom is gorgeous. Having to pay daily for decent wifi came as a surprise however. I didn‚Äôt end up doing it, and made it work with the free wifi, but it was kinda painful to get work done. Carol was very attentive and answered all of my questions really quickly though.\nAlso, the Palms building had very dirty windows, I‚Äôm not sure how often they clean them, but it would appear not that often. And the key cards are easily demagnetized which was a little inconvenient. I had to get three replacements durning my stay. These problems are with the building though, not with the host. It was overall a positive experience.', 'Carol was very responsive with all requests. The building staff was extremely friendly and the building was quiet and pleasant.', ""I booked a room with the balcony and Carol confirmed before I booked that this unit will come with a balcony. On my arrival the room did not come with a balcony, which was very misleading to me to book the room. I called Carol and she told me that she made a mistake and booked me for the wrong unit and offer me 107$ for her mistake. Only reason I took the 107$ bc I didn't want try to find another room doing the 4/20 holiday. If you book her, make sure she have you booked for the right room before you make the trip to Las Vegas. I felt lied to so I will not use her service again."", 'Modern space, which was very clean upon arrival.

Thanks Carol.', 'Great place in a good location.', 'Very quick with responses, amazing view, security had you show your card everytime you entered the building which made me feel a lot safer.

Everywhere we went was a very short distance away, there‚Äôs free parking on site, and the view from the floor to ceiling windows is even better than pictured.

You will literally never be disappointed. Reserve with confidence..', 'The view is incredible and the space was very clean. Having a kitchen in LV is really a treat. Would stay again in a heartbeat.', ""We enjoyed Carol's place so much! It was exactly as described. The best part was the nightly view of the Strip. The place was super clean as well. The location was awesome. It was just far enough from the Strip, but close enough if we wanted to venture onto the Strip. Check-in and check-out were a breeze too. The only downside for me was the amount of pot smell/smoke throughout the property. I understand that it's legal there, however, the smoke and smell is EVERYWHERE. If you're sensitive to smells and smoke, just be prepared to bring lots of headache meds to manage it. Otherwise, we will definitely be coming back to Carol's place. It's the best place we've rented in Vegas thus far."", 'There was a clean-seal on the door letting you know that the room had been cleanedüëçüèæ. Very quiet I would definitely stay here again. The only draw back ( out of owners control) is that during the pandemic The Palms Casino is closed so it‚Äôs was hard to get taxis, Uber‚Äôs and Lyfts (about 45-1hr wait time).

As is the way in Vegas you are going to smell the weed coming from a mystery location but IT‚ÄôS VEGAS! :-) Very pleasant stay, amazing view, great price and easy to book. Couldn‚Äôt ask for anything more!', ""The place is as described and very clean for guests to stay in. I highly recommend Carol's place for several reasons. First the location is close to the strip which makes it very easy to catch a ride or bus. Also there's a walkway which leads into Palms Casino where you are able to play and eat. Everything inside the room seems to be good except for a water leak in the bathroom sink which causes the water to be all around the sink.

Overall, it was a great stay.', 'Very comfortable and stylish room. The bath and shower are beautiful.

Free parking and nice amenities.', 'Lobby was nice and the Place was just like the pictures', 'Perfect place. excellent spot!!!!', ""This location is prime with only a short uber/rideshare trip to any part of the main strip. Parking associated with this location is also included with your stay so that helps not having to pay extra resort fees for parking.

I would definitely check on status at the lake next time. I didn‚Äôt really agree with the cleaning rules. I brought my own towels for that reason. If you stain a towel $20 each if you don‚Äôt wash your dishes $ charge. I have red hair it will leave color on towels. That was a bit much.', 'Great location. Couch that pulls out to a bed is broken and very uncomfortable to sleep on. We had to put cushions from the couch under it just so it was somewhat even and not slouching down on the corner thats broke. Bathroom towels were stained with blood or makeup and hair in them. However I let host know and he did send clean towels. But he did not respond when I asked if there was an air mattress to use because of the broken sofa bed. Otherwise good place to stay if you don‚Äôt need the extra bed. Very beautiful location at the lake. Easy to get in.', 'Check in and out was super easy.

I'm so glad we did. This place is clean, roomy, peaceful, and just like home. Check in was easy, just as Andy said. Parking was not too far away and no problem as you are able to unload at the lobby and then park, there is a bell cart available which is convenient. The condo itself was clean and inviting. We didn't cook any meals but we could have as kitchen is fully stocked with anything you'd need. The refrigerator was clean and full sized with ice and water in the door. The bed was comfy and we slept good. We will definitely stay again. The location is perfect. There is construction going on but it didn't bother us.

When I tried to fold it back up into the couch, it kept slipping down underneath so the frame would not fold back into the couch. I had to take the mattress out to get the couch to close back up. Then, I had to lean the mattress against the wall... and then the couch cushions wouldn't fit correctly so I couldn't even sleep on the couch. I had to sleep on the floor. Also, there were black hairs on the sheets ( I'm blonde) that were provided for the fold out... just gross! My friend slept in the bedroom as planned. ( I'm single and I sleep alone). Andy's voice mail was full all day for check in and he couldn't be reached. He had told me I might get an early check in, but, I left several texts, no reply. I've called again after check out, no answer. I have stayed at several airbnb's and always had a decent bed to sleep in, the hosts return my calls and texts. But not this host.

Fortunately we had our own towels with us. Some of the outlets did not work properly and the TV only allowe for 1 channel. The bedroom TV did not work at all. No directions for the TV in the bedroom either. The shampoo was from the dollar tree and I didnt see any soap. Again we had our own. The worst part was the beds and the pillows. The pillows were hard like a couch pillow not soft like a bed pillow. the bed was lumpy and uncomfortable. The unit faces the rear of the complex where they are digging and building under construction. I dont mind that but really at 6am!!! We were waken by the construction noise at 6am.

It really was the perfect place for me to get done what I needed to!"", 'Great host, everything was perfect.', 'Great clean place to stay close to Chinatown.

Great value compared to other nearby properties.', 'We loved that it was quiet and away from the hustle and bustle (we don‚Äôt gamble) but still an easy walk through MGM Grand to get to the strip. Plenty of space, utensils and drink ware, and towels. We had a question about the bed and were assured it‚Äôd be addressed. As for strip view, you can see parts of it but there aren‚Äôt any lights keeping you up at night. We didn‚Äôt use the pool for our tower but did take advantage of the MGM Grand‚Äôs lazy river. Bring your own tubes like we did, otherwise you‚Äôll be stuck paying $25+ for one. There is a TON of construction going on for the F1 race in November but we didn‚Äôt hear any of it. We would definitely stay here again if we were to come back to Vegas.', 'Joe was a great host. He checked on us several times throughout the trip. He very helpful and provides information to make check in smooth. We will rent from them again.', 'The owner made sure everything was up to par, and the hotel staff were very welcoming. Excellent communication and service.', 'The place is as described and as pictured. Very clean, hotel feel. Check in was fine, transportation to and from was good as well. Nothing to complain about on this one.', 'What a great location!!! Having direct access to the MGM and the monorail made things so easy as was having a kitchen for light meals and snacks. Better than a regular hotel room. We also walked along the strip to many places. The suite was in tip top shape, very clean, and exactly as shown in the listing.

Connected to the mgm casino and food court.', 'Everything went smoothly. Location was perfect for my visit. Room spacious, the bed was super comfortable, very clean place. Would book again. The host is very responsive and very friendly.', 'You will not be disappointed with this wonderful unit at the MGM signature! We loved having such a large space. It was clean and great views of the sunset on the strip. The kitchen was great! We preferred making our own coffee rather than wait forever at Starbucks downstairs. Loved having a small kitchen too for snacking! Joe & Debra were gracious hosts. They answered questions quickly and we had great communication throughout. Love that Tower 1 has its own pool area. If you want something quieter it‚Äôs great or if you prefer a more party atmosphere the pools at MGM Grand are great too! All in all this is SO much better than a hotel and paying all those resort fees. You just have to walk through MGM to get to the strip. Another welcome note is that if you like to gamble but hate smoke - the Park MGM hotel is just across the street and the only non-smoking casino. We loved that! Thanks Joe & Debra!', 'Love how everything is connected and so easy to get to! Room is top notch! Will definitely be back', 'Joe‚Äôs condo is the perfect weekend getaway for Vegas.

Very likely to stay in this room again- just a great value for luxury stay. Joe is a great host as well!', ""My husband and I enjoyed our stay. The only little hiccup we had was the $300 at check-in as I wasn't aware of it. It took away from the spending money we had, which was a bit annoying. Other than that, the place was as described. We loved the security system and free valate park. The location is within 10 minutes of most popular places. We definitely recommend and will be returning whenever we visit Vegas again!

I would stay there again in a heartbeat. I needed some help with something and the Joe was extremely helpful and responded quickly.

A great stay!', 'We loved everything about Joe‚Äôs place. Joe‚Äôs directions were easy to follow. Getting through the gate to the property was a breeze. The check in was easy even though it was 12:30 at night. Valet service is quick as was the delivery of our luggage. The building is really quiet compared to most Las Vegas accommodations. The entire suite was clean and modern. When we entered the suite the huge glass windows allowed us to see the lights of Vegas while still feeling private. The soaking tub in the bathroom was very relaxing after visiting locations and walking all day. As a bonus the wireless charger was great for my phone. The location to MGM Grand is great. Super quick access through moving walkways. Driving wise we were really close to everything. We didn‚Äôt use the monorail but it is a great option.

We had all the info we needed to check-in making it seemless. The Suite was tremendous and better than any place I have stayed on the strip by far. We will definitely be staying again, and would recommend to anyone looking for luxury at a great price. There can't be enough nice things said.

All in all, good value for money in Vegas.', 'Last minute booking and everything went smoothly at a great price!', 'This location is in a great spot!

I recommend this host!', 'Joe was a great host! Clear instructions and very polite and responsive!', ""The room is okay, parkingüöó is very inconvenient, there is no way to park in the location twice, you need to park at MGM's hotel and go back to the apartment, it takes about 40 minutes to get back and forth.Very inconvenient!Several of the guests were in their temper and there was a pregnant woman and a gentleman who was directly in the lobby.We ended up calling the police to deal with it. We stayed for five nights and wanted to discuss with the landlord that we could check out late, but it was‚ùå particularly unreasonable... I don't recommend it overall, it's still more convenient to manage the hotel management system."", 'Within walking distance to the strip. Kitchenette was great to have for coffee and breakfast.

Check in was extremely easy and the communication between Joe and the hotel staff made it truly seamless.

The room was clean and felt spacious for a Las Vegas trip for two!', 'Great place to stay with many exciting things to do that are walking distance. Will definitely stay again.', 'The stay was great! Location walking distance from strip. It is a hotel but you won‚Äôt get service like it‚Äôs a hotel.

The valet gets a lil packs sometimes takes almost up to a hr to get your car it is very slow in the morning & at night but overall the experience was great just be aware that you will not be serviced like a hotel when it come to getting extra towel & using the dryer & washer system.

Walk a little farther towards the MGM Grand and there is a great Starbucks with a shorter line about 5 minutes walk. There is a quiet pool at Tower 1 signature MGM.

Great price too compared to other rooms here. Check in was easy. Communication was great. Would recommend!', 'This was our second time in Vegas and we will be renting a condo at The Sig from now on! It is super peaceful and great for decompressing after a long day/night on the Strip. Takes about 10 to 15 minutes to get to the Strip walking through MGM but only takes about 7 to get to The MGM Grand pool and monorail station. The room itself is a good sized suite with a pullout couch, king size bed (could have been comfier) kitchenette, fridge and bar. The huge shower and bathroom were a plus. The jacuzzi was loud but there are hot tubs on the property and at the grand so ü§∑\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏è The balcony and view are what really sell this place, great view of Hilton, Cosmo, Aria, PH, Horseshoe, Sig pools, and the mountains. They also only held a $100 deposit when I was expecting 300 so that was cool. Everything was clean but the place is slightly worn, not in a bad way but could use a little refresh! The condo next door was under construction which resulted in some LOUD mornings.

This is a room--which is what I asked for--and for a room it's priced right. It's located in an active home in North LV.\nThe goods: Rodolfo made it easy--he sent me good instructions to get in, and reached out to make sure all was well. The interior of the home is clean (how do they do that while living there?), each tenant is provided a room key and a towel set (just make sure to use only yours!), and the bathroom is shared (so wait your turn and keep it clean). There is also a shared mini fridge and microwave in the hall . There were no issues, and it was nice to hear the homeowners talking in the evening. Rodolfo keeps the place nice and cool in the summer--my room had its own register.\nThe nitpicks: there are some noisy neighbors. The home is near a major street which is NOT noisy ...except morning rush hour. The tub is good for a shower but there is no plug for a bath. And if you're there during the day you'll notice the dogs will bark at you."", ""Rodolfo and his family are warm and welcoming hosts with an adorable and friendly furry little friend. They even invited me to join them for dinner, which I regrettably had to pass on those nights due to prior engagements. :(\nThe area was great! Everything one could need is a few blocks from the house. Shopping, food, library, gas, etc. Only a short drive down to the strip for the nightlife experience.\nThe room was good for my stay, too. Folks weren't lying. The pics don't do justice to just how nice the house is. Stayed upstairs in the room right across from the bathroom, which was always pristine. There was a TV in the room and a speedy internet connection that I could both stream my firestick off of and do my work on my laptops and tablets. The bed was large and comfortable and I never had a bad night's sleep. Also had a fridge right outside the room, so getting a midnight snack was never a problem.\nThere was free curbside parking outside the house. Occasionally it would get crowded, but it was never an issue while I was there. Check in and out were smooth clearly outlined processes.\nNothing bad to say about my mans, Rodolfo. Highly recommend!"", 'will stay again.', 'Rodolfo is very nice. We met him on the first day\nI believe there are three rooms for rent in this house. The upstairs has a shared bathroom with rooms #2 & #3. The sinks are numbered indicating what room it belongs to, this is nice. The bathroom doors, mirror, and light switches seemed to have been overlooked by the cleaner and need some attention.\nThere is no indoor areas to use other than your room, as stated in the house rules, but you‚Äôre welcome to sit outside, although there is nothing to sit on. There are pigeons that live on the roof and leave their droppings just to the right of the front door, and it loooks like the the car in the driveway has an oil leak so be careful not to drag oil or droppings in on your shoes.\nWe stayed in room #3 so if you like a very soft bed this room is for you. The previous guests had left some of their garbage behind in our room, behind the night table and under the bed. There is wastebasket in the room that I used.', 'My month long extended stay with Rodolfo went amazing!\nI was sent to North Las Vegas for a month long clinical medical internship and was in need of a place to stay. I was so lucky I found this room at Rodolfos, he went above and beyond to accommodate me. From blocking out the rented room next to me so I wouldn‚Äôt need to worry about other people coming and going, having the bathroom to myself, to paying me back for a day of my stay that I didn‚Äôt end up needing he was wonderful.\nHis home is beautiful and cool in the Vegas spring heat. Marble and cool tones are stunning. Easy access to the home and room with my own key. The room had a good closet, big tv stand and two night stands, plenty of storage. The neighborhood was nice and street parking was never an issue at any time. The area is a more closed off housing location, but go out a couple blocks and you‚Äôre right in the middle of a shopping/restaurant place. So many food places nearby (I recommend Famous Chicago Style Taco a little over a mile away.).\nIf I ever end up staying in the area again I know where I‚Äôll try to stay.\nEasily recommend!', 'Would definitely return.

I have also stayed at plenty of so-so airbnbs where the host was so nice that I didn't write obvious issues (as others had not either). But John's place?? ALL TRUE. He is truly a great host and the accommodations are better than pictured. I guess those are older photos because he now has the tv mounted on the wall in front of the bed. He also has a faux fireplace/heater underneath the tv...which believe it or not, I actually needed and used.

However,The location itself seemed to be in a not very great area of town. It was quite noisy at night and many of the yards were unkempt.

This is also somewhat misrepresented as sleeps 6 but there is only 2 bedrooms. You must request an air mattress minimum 24 hrs in advance, which not everyone would know.', 'good', 'A very kind and friendly environment, located in a green area. Everything matches the uploaded pictures perfectly, and it is very well-equipped. Getting in and out of the apartment is very easy. The parking is excellent, and its accessibility/location is advantageous. I can recommend it to everyone.', 'Thank you for the great stay! Will definitely book in the future \U0001faf6', 'A great place, I‚Äôll definitely stay again. Convenient clean and affordable.', 'Nice place', 'very clean and neat. nicely decorated, and close to the strip, shopping, and dining. perfect place to stay whenever visiting Las Vegas.', 'The property was clean, although some of the facilities felt a bit tired. It was easy to get into The Strip by taxi. Overall we had a good time during our stay.', 'Taylor and Pat‚Äôs place is located in the southern area of Las Vegas, just a few minutes away from the Strip casinos.\nThe place is quite large and has all basic necessities ‚Äîit‚Äôs located inside a gated community, therefore is quiet and safe.\nThe only problem that I see is that the cleaning fee is quite large if you‚Äôre considering to stay in just for a few days ‚Äîprobably for longer stays might make sense. I understand this is an external expense that the owners have little control on pricing but I‚Äôm a landlord myself in Vegas and I know the cost is excessive as a flat fee ‚Äîprobably a dynamic cleaning rate contingent to a responsible and tidy Airbnb guest (like myself) could probably bring more value for shorter stays. My two cents.\nBut I‚Äôd happily rent again from Taylor and Pat üòå', 'Everything was as described. Great location and great communication', 'This is an apartment it was clean and as described for the most part. It does not sleep 6 only 4, but they provide an air mattress. Taylor was very responsive and was quick to fix any issues. The apartment was clean, close to the strip, and the only downside is if you have friends or family that are not staying at the apartment with you, they can not visit she only allows 6 people in the apartment at one time. we made it work.\nThank you, Taylor', 'We had a great stay! Place was exactly as described in terms of what is and is not available. We found the location very convenient to go to the strip, to Death Valley and super close to the grocery store. The place was very clean, which we appreciated. We would stay here again.', 'It was a great gated community, perfect for a short or long stay.', 'This is an amazing place. Great location, close to restaurants, grocery stores, outlets, the airport, and of course 10 minutes away from the strip.\nThe apartment was exactly as described and absolutely clean. Taylor is a super host, provided great instructions and was always responsive to any questions.\nWe will always be looking forward to come back here for a weekend getaway üòÅ', 'Good location.\nThe apartment was a bit run down.\nPlastic silverware and paper plates, limited toilet paper and no paper towel‚Äôs provided.\nYou have to pay additional parking fees.', 'Wonderful place to stay, is a quiet and very safe neighborhood.', 'The place was okay. It just had very cheap furnishings, only paper plates and plastic silverware, cheap k-cups and the worst part was the bed. Seriously, the bed dipped in the center and it killed our backs for days afterwards.\nOverall, it wasn‚Äôt awful but definitely not worth what we paid. Plus, she bombards you over an over with all the rules and how if you break the rules then you will pay. You do ‚Äúx‚Äù and she will charge you. You do ‚Äúy‚Äù and she will charge you. It‚Äôs just condescending and the vibe is just off-putting.', 'Enjoyed my stay, very comfortable and spacious.', 'Great place, super clean, comfortable, spacious. Perfect location, all amenities there. Our kids loved it!', ""The place was safe, spacious spaces for 5 people, the weather inside the house optimal for the heat it was . We didn't have any problems . Thank you very much for everything ."", 'Everything it said it would be. Thank you.', 'clean, spacious apartment with good bedding. well located compared to the airport and the strip while being quiet. however it is unfortunate to have only disposable dishes from an ecological point of view and in addition it is not pleasant to use. the recommendations of the hosts, before and during the stay are useful, understandable but too insistent.\noverall, I recommend this rental.', 'It is an old apartment with disposable cutlery and no basic food amenities like salt pepper oil. It is definitely not a condo so be careful! Host Taylor is very inconsiderate. Shortly after you book you cannot cancel you are stuck with her and she refuses to cancel with full refund and sends you a whole big list of rules to follow otherwise you pay extra fine to her. Be careful when booking this listing! Everything was super basic and plastic. Nothing luxury or nice. Main entrance is also very inconvenient. Very highly disappointed!', 'Great place to stay. I would highly recommend', 'Taylor‚Äôs place was great! It was spotless & very spacious! Close to the strip and everything we wanted to do! Would definitely stay here again.', 'U get what u pay for. Probably 500 apartments in the neighborhood and if u come in at night u can‚Äôt see the bldg nr or parking place number. I suggested using fluorescent paint but Taylor‚Äôs sidekick informed me they don‚Äôt own the bldg. So u go ask them if u can pay to paint the bldg nr. As a rental property owner I would be receptive to that offer. When ur getting ready to leave they send very threatening texts of what‚Äôs going to happen if u don‚Äôt do this or that. Place is clean. Taylor was very nice but her sidekick could use some lessons in courtesy. I‚Äôd still recommend this place.', 'This place is located well but will not make you feel at home. It looks good on pictures, but dinner table and chairs are really shabby, chairs have stained seats. Worst, not a single glass, cup, plate or dinner cutlery is available. Only the cheap plastic cutlery that breaks easily and a handful of the styrofoam bowls and paper plates are there. On request I was told that they only provide supplies for the first few days. (Why is there a dishwasher??), also, way too many rules on what cannot be done. You are trapped there on the inside, as no pedestrian access code is given for the locked gate and there is a fine if you ask the management. However, you can go in and out with the car at anytime. Not bad, but I wouldn‚Äôt go back to stay there.', 'Pros: Very large, good to find and still nice and close to the casions. At night it is also quiet outside and you feel quite safe despite the thin entrance door. Providers respond to all emails very quickly and promptly resolve issues.\nNegative: All furniture in the living area was either scratched and damaged or stained (all chairs at the dining table!). The outlets of the air conditioner were all (!) completely dusty (there was 2x a cleaning team to clean). In the kitchen, the paint is already off. The parking costs extra, but you only learn that after booking. From the neighbor you can hear every step and the conditioning is very noisy. All faucets are old and spacky. The welcome email is a list of all the things you are not allowed to do and what penalty payment you get for it - very least.\nConclusion: Some color, a few modern furniture and skillful photos long not to overlook the fact that an old apartment was quickly cleaned up to make money.', '1 week business trip. Quiet, comfortable for work. Not the closest to the Strip but that was intentional. Very good communication with the host. If you are looking for a quiet place in LV, this place would certainly serve the goal.', 'Super clean. Had some trouble finding the apartment as the numbers were right at the door and we didnt want to be snooping on everyone‚Äôs door. Come the find out the apartment was right in front of our designated parking. Overall my guests and I enjoyed our stay.', 'The location was a short distance from groceries, dining, fun, and the Las Vegas strip. The hosts answered any questions I had almost immediately and were super thorough in communication and expectations. Great place to stay, super clean!', 'Everything was great! Very clear and civilized approach to clients. Thank you!', 'Would definitely come back here to stay next time we are in Vegas!', ""It was hard to find, but it's not the host's fault, but the more the arrangement of the blocks and the scan of the apartment blocks that is randomly done, it looks like.\nOtherwise nothing to say, very spacious, clean."", 'The apartment was perfect for our trip and was close enough to the strip and other amenities that it was a quick drive. The only negatives would be that it wasn‚Äôt listed that there would be an addition $10 charger per day for parking. Also there were a lot of potential penalties if certain rules were broken but I feel like this is just being a good guest so it was no problem for us.\nOtherwise great for our stay and we would book with the lister again.', 'We liked the location and the apartment, we have been in several places and I never touch you before that for everything you would like to charge, if you were very attentive to everything that was presented in our stay but also messages that we considered could be omitted, there were no bags for the garbage and you had to leave clean or you would be charged extra in addition to what is already paid in the fee, there were only two rolls of paper for an apartment that receives up to 6 guests, when we rent a place we are always aware that it is not ours and must be taken care of, on this occasion we felt super pressured by so much rule and we were almost not in the place. Overall good, only if there should be a little flexibility and avoid so many messages during the stay so that we can make the guest feel more comfortable unless something is necessary', 'It was as described and was close the convention center making Ubers reasonable! Good for the price.', 'When booking through the app, we enjoyed the location‚Äôs proximity to the strip and other activities. However, it was difficult to enjoy the home because the host continually sent messages about potential upcharges. The rules were already posted in the home, and if you don‚Äôt follow them closely, you risk additional charges. This over-communication was annoying and made it hard to relax. Additionally, there were barely any supplies, such as toilet paper and soap, to the point where we had to purchase necessities for daily use.', 'This is a quiet spot not far from the strip. It was perfect for us as we enjoyed getting out to do all the natural fun that Nevada and the surrounding area has to offer- like the Hoover dam is only around 30 minutes away! The strip is easy to get to and navigate (there is some free parking if you look for it - Venetian for us). We felt super safe in the quiet gated complex and there was plenty of healthy food options nearby.', 'great spot. close to the strip.', ""Had an okay time but wouldn't stay here again because of the hidden fees and bare bones quality.\nPros: Location was great. 15 mins to the strip. Felt safe inside the gated community. Air condition was reliable.\nCons: Listing details are misleading. The listing says fits 6 guests, but there's only 2 bedrooms. You can request an air mattress, which will cost you $20. In my opinion, the air mattress should be included since the listing says you can have 6 guests.\nThe amenities list was also misleading. It said they have a coffee maker (Keurig) and coffee. They even have a photo of the Keurig with coffee pods. But you actually have to click the photo to reveal the caption that says they DON'T include coffee pods. Same with kitchen basics, the hidden photo caption says disposables only.\nParking says it's paid, but they only tell you after booking that it's $10/day/car.\nIf you wanted to check in early, that's also $75.\nDefinitely read all the reviews to know what you're in for."", 'Apartment is fine, close to the strip, clean, everything is basic. Some unsupervised kids threw rocks at our car in the parking lot, other than that, the neighbourhood is fine. There is parking available onsite that is free, it‚Äôs not right in front of the apartment, but the host didn‚Äôt tell us that, they went straight to upcharging for it.', 'Unexpected fees for parking. I did not see anywhere on the listing, nor was it listed in the original prices the fee for parking. The day before check-in, the host informed me that each parking space was an additional $10 per night and we needed two spaces, so I paid an additional $180. that was not expected! Also, the supplies were woefully insufficient! There was one-half roll of toilet paper per bathroom, absolutely no wash clothes, one towel per person, paper plates were paper thin, plastic silverware, a roll of cheap paper towels. Though we did not have the time to go shopping for these items, we were forced to because the host refused to supply any other supplies. The location was perfect for getting to the places we needed to go. FYI, I have never given less than 5 stars to an Airbnb, but I cannot give this host 5 stars. If I had read a review such as this, I would have either just kept looking, or would have been more prepared and brought some of those missing items with me!!!', 'Very good service, nice place near the strip. The apartment is very good.', 'Roku in every room, quite and peaceful complex. I would and do live in a place very similar. Everything is as advertised and more.', 'Everything was great! The location is perfect close to restaurants and walking distance from them!', 'Great value. Warm and cozy and very clean. We felt safe in a unfamiliar location. I would highly recommend.', 'The reviews say there are a lot of rules, and there were lots and lots of additional charges if you defy the rule. We found the spot and the house to be accommodating. There was a library right across the street for the kids and a liquor store for the adults. Loved that lol! It‚Äôs much bigger than the pictures look. It has a huge walk-in closet and a large bathtub. Very nice to relax it after the 108* day. Thank you for hosting us.', 'Our stay in Vegas was great! Super quaint little condo JUST off the beaten path so super walkable or ride share friendly that won‚Äôt completely break the bank. Parking was steps away from the unit which made checking in a literal breeze!', ""over all it was a nice stay, place is nice. but we're asked to be quiet at all time s and people on top we're very load. would be cool to use the pool and gym. there is over flow parking so the charge for parking was not necessary. place was nice and clean. if ur just wanting a place to sleep while u have fun in the strip it's great. thank you for letting us stay with y'all and hope to come back soon. we have a wedding in October lol\nwhen"", 'My friend and I really enjoyed our stay here. The place is super cute and in a gated community. Was very clean and spacious for 2 people. As stated, there only is disposable silverware etc so only thing I would recommend is to bring more of your own paper plates etc before coming if you plan to cook and have more than 1 or 2 people coming!', ""Taylor's place is located within a apartment/condo project. I found the space numbers and the place hard to find in the dark. Once located, access was easy, sneezy. The apartment was neat and clean. There was only plastic utensils and things were on the minimalist side. I was attending a conference, so being away from the strip and the crowds was a welcome relief. There are some rules to follow, but I guess that is to be expected when you're in a complex like that. Overall. I slept well!"", 'Wonderful stay. Would definitely stay again', 'Really comfortable and quiet', 'We enjoyed our stay! Very convenient location and safe neighborhood. Apartment was very clean and cozy! Honestly, plastic silverware feels extremely weird and uncomfortable - especially the availability was absolutely limited and definitely not enough. Only one laundry detergent pod provided‚Ä¶ not sure how the guests are supposed to use one pod while apartment allows max 6 people to stay. We were 3 of us and one pod was definitely not enough. Overall, good stay and very convenient location. Close to Allegiant stadium and the strip!', 'Accommodation was great size and very clean. Easy check in and out. Easy access to restaurants and Las Vegas entertainment events.', 'Simply put, this place was exactly what was expected plus a little bit more. Great deal, great communication, great space and location. I would return if the opportunity presents itself. Thank you.', ""Very clean.

I'm happy to go back.\nThanks Tyler!"", 'This place was clean and great for my little family!

The unit was much more spacious than we expected, and Taylor was a great host. The bathroom supplies she left were especially useful. The location is far enough from the strip to avoid the traffic but still close to tons of great restaurants and things to do.

I am a teacher and I‚Äôve been teaching for 27 years and I understand what it means to have rules. Believe me , your rules are excessive simply too many . People want to enjoy their vacation and not feel like they‚Äôre in a college dorm . Is this an Airbnb or is this a jail? There‚Äôs too many rules and you make the guest feel restricted .

Everything was shiny sparkling clean and the suite is nicely decorated. The kitchen was nicely stocked with everything needed. It made it a pleasure to get takeout and eat in.

The location is perfect for walking the strip also. My only issue was with the valets. This has nothing to do with the hosts or there property but, if you are driving, they shut down valet early some nights and make you park in MGM. They will also tell you valet is full sometimes even when it is not. If you tip them they will take care of you but, make sure you have cash, we had a bad experience with this but, again no reflections on the hosts or condo itself. That was great just be cautious with the valets if driving. I would stay here again based on the condo itself and hosts.', 'Great stay. Would use again. Hosts very nice and responsive.

I assume that is why there are no TVs in the rooms. Everyone was very quiet and respectful. I used my laptop with headphones so as not to bother anyone. And I put a rolled up towel in front of the door gap for extra privacy. I was very comfortable and would stay with Orly again. I have always stayed in rooms with private baths and entries.

The Wi-Fi in the lobby and Starbucks worked perfectly, which suggests that the problem is specific to the hotel's infrastructure.\nThe coffee machine could also be upgraded to a pod machine, as it currently uses ground/filter pads, which aren‚Äôt ideal.\nOverall, I would recommend staying at the Signature Suites."", 'We enjoyed our stay at this spacious condo.

If you and your family are on the louder side, be mindful this unit is attached to their home so the walls aren‚Äôt very sound proof. Nonetheless, we would definitely recommend this place and plan to stay again.', 'We really enjoyed our stay here! Upon arriving they had a welcome basket of goodies that we thought was such a sweet gesture. They even included Powerade which was greatly appreciated in the Vegas heat. This cute studio is tastefully decorated & has all your essentials. If you need something there is a Family Dollar located down the street. It was clean and communication from the host was timely and informative. The A/C was strong and felt amazing to come back to after a day outside. The back massager was a great touch as well. All in all it was perfect for my husband and I. Highly recommend. If we are ever in vegas again we will definitely be back. Thank you so much!', 'Great place to stay. 12 mins away from the strip, good location not much traffic. Place looked just like in pictures.

The neighborhood was very quiet and calm. The blinds block out the sun so well and that was nice especially after a night out. There are many places to eat near by and if you want to head to the strip it is not far. Ailyn is always quick with responding to messages.

Made our visit to Vegas very comfortable."", 'I was looking for a small place not too overly priced but nice enough and close enough for my NYE stay in Vegas. This place was perfect. It‚Äôs down the street from the 95 freeway which was about less than a 15 minute drive to downtown. There‚Äôs a McDonald‚Äôs across the way and a dollar store. If you‚Äôre into fitness, it‚Äôs close to LV gym and about 15 minutes from 24 hour fitness. Also it‚Äôs close to Jay cutlets eatery, which have great pictures on teriyaki bowls :) this place is a great size for a quick weekend getaway, they have a water kettle warmer and coffee press which was great for me since I have to have coffee every morning. There is a regular size fridge and gas stove. Only thing missing was a microwave and a mirror, there is a small mirror in the bathroom but it‚Äôs Vegas I wanted a long one to see my outfit :) the price of the unit is reasonable considering it‚Äôs Vegas, the cleaning fee was a bit high $150 compared to other places charging 75$ but I factored in the location and the esthetics of the place, therefore I decided this place was worth it!!! Can‚Äôt go wrong if you want to stay close and quick weekend gateway.. will definitely stay here again when I‚Äôm back in Vegas!!!', 'The place was nice and clean with a perfectly hot shower. The bed is memory foam which made it hard for me to change positions because I sank in. We had to extend our stay at the very last minute. Ailyn was kind enough to respond quickly.

The location was great for us because we were spending time in Red Rocks. Ailyn‚Äôs instructions were clear and easy to follow. She responded to the one question that I had very quickly. I read other reviews before booking, so I expected the place to be more clean than what I experienced. The shower/ bathroom wasn‚Äôt as clean as I would hope it to be. We also weren‚Äôt given any hand soap for the bathroom, so we ended up using the body wash that was left for us. The sofa, which isn‚Äôt the one pictured, is stained.

That wasn‚Äôt a deal breaker for me but I would have been disappointed if our stay was longer.', 'Really good place we loved it honestly. ü•∞ everything clean organized AC Omg that was a life saver !!!!

Place was easy to find and check in was a breeze. Place has a modern feel to it. Place was spotless when we checked in. Nice and bright inside with plenty of lighting. We didn't cook, but a little portal stove is available if you need to cook. Bed was clean and comfortable. Bathroom also nice and clean. Overall a very cozy little place to relax. I definitely recommend this place if you're visiting Vegas and you have a car. This place is also close to Red Rock Canyon which is a must see if you're in the area. Will definitely stay here again in the future."", 'My wife and I stayed at Ailyn‚Äôs studio and we could have not picked a better spot to use for our vacation.

Highly recommend it if you are in the area.', 'It was lovely to have a cozy little place to call ‚Äúhome‚Äù while we weren‚Äôt actively out doing things. Great little space, great price, and within 15 minutes of any of the major attractions. Honestly what more could you want?', 'Great little spot for a few days. Will definitely stay again the next time I‚Äôm in town for work.', 'Very comfortable and cute stay', 'For what you pay for the stay isn‚Äôt bad. The host was very responsive and helpful when there wasn‚Äôt detergent for the washing machine. The couch was extensively stained and had crumbs on it upon our arrival and the fridge was grimey. You are staying inside of a home with someone on the other side of the wall and they have a dog that barks fairly often. The walls are not soundproof and you can hear the dog as if the wall wasn‚Äôt there. The neighbor also keeps a dog outside that woke us up at 730/800 in the morning everyday. You also cannot put the AC lower than 68 or else you will be fined $900 which may not be a big deal for some but being from up north I like to sleep cold so it was hot for me trying to sleep. Personally I didn‚Äôt love this listing and wouldn‚Äôt stay here again. The hosts were very nice though and responsive.', 'Beautiful place easy to check in loved it', 'Great spot to stay at not to far from the strip. Perfect for a weekend in Las Vegas. Looking forward to staying here again.', 'This is such a great place to stay. The place was clean and the a/c unit won‚Äôt fail you! The host responds so fast to any messages and I love that. The large shower head in the bathroom was a god send for me. So relaxing! This unit is a perfect fit for two guest. Not too small not too big. All the little touches were so cute. A welcoming snack packet as we arrived. Extra everything was supplied. Laundry detergent, toilet paper, dish soap, towels, blankets. Ailyn definitely pays attention to detail.\nThe neighbors to the right of the home are very nice people as well. All in all it is a comfortable place to stay and has lots of restaurants and shops blocks away. It‚Äôs not too far from a freeway entrance so getting around to Fremont, the strip and all other places was super convenient. It‚Äôs a 36 min drive from air bnb to 7 Magic Mountains and definitely worth the drive. About 25 mins to the Las Vegas View Point, again worth the drive. If you stay you will be greatly pleased. I‚Äôd definitely stay again.

Kc also has a cat- which could deter people who do not like pets but the cat was not bothersome at all for me. Definitely a recommend !!!', 'I hope to book with Kc again next year!', ""Overall, my stay at Kc's property was a mixed experience. The host was responsive and provided clear check-in instructions, which was appreciated. However, the cleanliness of the room left much to be desired. Upon arrival, I noticed hairs and dust/dirt buildup, as well as Cheeto pieces and sugary drink stains on the floor. Also, there were stains on the bedding, which was disappointing. Although I contacted the host about these issues and they promptly changed the bedding and swept the dirt, the floor still had stains, indicating that a thorough clean was not done. Furthermore, I was surprised to find that the host later requested an extra fee for cleaning and an additional guest. I found this concerning, especially since I had taken pictures and videos of the property at check-out to document the conditions.\nThe host also requested me to not leave a negative review which was odd. My stay was not terrible, it could have been improved with proper cleaning and transparency.""]",['1 bed ¬∑ Shared bathroom'],https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/845933502473231934?adults=1&category_tag=Tag%3A8678&children=0&enable_m3_private_room=true&infants=0&pets=0&photo_id=1605664905&search_mode=regular_search&check_in=2024-11-10&check_out=2024-11-15&source_impression_id=p3_1729468530_P3-TSSFVZodubonF&previous_page_section_name=1000&federated_search_id=ea32d760-3f15-4c9f-877c-258f60af2617

Can‚Äôt wait to go back!', 'Michelle was a pleasure to work with as a host. Her place was absolutely beautiful, clean and was a super convenient location. We would not hesitate to stay there again. Beautiful view of the Vegas lights after dark and even saw a gorgeous sunset. Thanks again Michelle!', 'I definitely recommend this property for several specific reasons. Michele is a terrific host as she responds very quickly and provides great information for making the stay enjoyable. Secondly the location is ideal if you are going to the Sphere or wanting to be close to the strip in general, as it is located close to the monorail. The property also features multiple pools for which we went to the pool number two that had covered areas that were free as opposed to other areas where you have to pay to sit in the shade. It also features a very nice pool with a hot tub and is very enjoyable. The the price for this unit was a great value and was actually slightly less than other comparable units.

I had stayed at the Signature Towers previously but we had great view as the room is a Penthouse. The room was spotless, we had clear instructions from Michelle, who was really helpful, responsive and friendly at all times.\nThe only issue was the parking situation at the Towers, which really spoilt our last night and was a major inconvenience when checking out. This is not related to the room but something to be aware of.\nWe were not told us on check in, that parking is first come first served basis. There are 600 spots for 1700 rooms. You have to park in the main MGM hotel, walk 20 minutes to the Tower and back again in the morning, to drive back for your luggage. This meant we had to factor in an extra hour when leaving. You also need to go to reception to get a card to not have to pay the parking fee.

Michelle was very atuned too needs and wants and we debut like we were always able to be in touch! Props!', 'We enjoyed the location at the Signature MGM tower 1. It was close enough to access all the amenities associated with MGM Grand but away from the hustle and bustle of casino and gave us a great place to decompress and rest up before our evening activities of concert. The weather was very windy so we did not get to partake in the pool amenities. Although Starbucks and bar/lounge were in tower 1 we did not use this round. We would stay again for another girls getaway or even discussed bringing our kids and spouses next time‚Ä¶ lol. Space was clean, bathroom a great size and as pictured in listing. Michelle was quick to respond to any inquires.', 'Michelle was an awesome host and would definitely book again.', 'Michelle‚Äôs place was exactly as promised and then some! The jacuzzi tub has jets, which made for superior relaxation and there‚Äôs a tv in the bathroom!! This was my favorite space!! The view from the balcony was amazing, whether day or night! There are literally mountains in every direction-it‚Äôs gorgeous to wake up to! And at night-the city of Lights!!!

For the more adventourous types, this house is also a great base to go to places such as Zion National Park and the Grand Canyon, which is what we did.']",['8 guests ¬∑ 4 bedrooms ¬∑ 5 beds ¬∑ 3 baths'],https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1172039892285532903?adults=1&children=0&enable_m3_private_room=true&infants=0&pets=0&search_mode=regular_search&check_in=2024-10-27&check_out=2024-11-01&source_impression_id=p3_1729468519_P3XBXTBOKtMIcple&previous_page_section_name=1000&federated_search_id=ca87106e-a759-4a5c-b0c4-5a1fedfcc254

The property management makes it a point to remind you that they do not provide typical hotel services unless you want to pay extra(even though it's basically a hotel). Was not a big deal, but it became irksome to be reminded of that with each correspondence. It was especially aggravating to be reminded of that in the same e-mail in which I was asked to take a few extra minutes to post about the property on social media. I am a marketing professional, and I did not feel like giving my services away for free on behalf of the company that constantly reminded me I would have to pay extra for clean towels. That being said, I'd stay there again."", ""Felt very well taken care of! This was our first time in Vegas, so we weren't entirely sure what to expect. The first room had some issues with a loose light fixture but the host team was very quick to swap us to another bigger room at no additional cost, which we were very satisfied with! They even sent maintainence up immediately the next day to fix a bedside lamp. 10/10 views, around the clock support, great unit and location.

The shower would randomly let water out once a night, but it didn‚Äôt bother us. We just joked that the ghost was taking its nightly shower lol. Our last night there the toilet started making this loud squealing sound but I just got up and flushed it and it stopped. One of the bathroom towels had a lot of makeup stains on it, but as a mother of 2 daughters it didn‚Äôt bother me. You can tell that the room is older but it was still nice. There‚Äôs plenty of restaurants at the location so you really wouldn‚Äôt have to leave if you didn‚Äôt want to.

Monitored security that makes you feel safe? Check!\nBefore arriving, Blair gave very clear instructions for checking in and even went as far as providing laminated instructions in the room for checking in and out, laundry procedures, and how to operate the TV. The room was exceptionally spick and span and inviting and warm-spirited. In addition, I couldn‚Äôt have had a better working environment for my remote writing job! Blair and Kiera even went above and beyond to provide a toaster, complimentary snacks and drinks, plates, silverware, and napkins, and they even had a Keurig and pods to meet your coffee needs. For those looking for an Air BnB that is reasonably priced, comfortable, with mentioned features, and close to the Strip, outlets, restaurants, shops, etc., you will find it at Blair‚Äôs studio. I will likely stay at the Smithville residence again if I find myself in Las Vegas. Overall, I give this place 4.8/5 stars. I could not have asked for a more better experience at my first Air BnB!

The addition of the 1/2 bath was a bonus as well, especially with four people. The unit was very clean, the view is incredible, especially at night. We would definitely stay here again. The suite is a nice quiet retreat from the busy strip, and minutes to Aria, and a short walk to Bellagio through the new connecting walkway. Rideshare is easy and at the main entrance so you don't have to walk to the other side of the property for a pick up like other places.

WOW! The place was really well furnished, tastefully done and very CLEAN!! That is always a big deal for us.\nThe elevator was super quick up to the 56th floor, liked how it was so consistently timely and quick.

This was 100% on MGM, not Kimia. Get there early because it usually fills up Friday by 5p. We walked or used rideshare everywhere so we didn't lose our parking spot.\nWe appreciate everything you did to make our trip so memorable. We would absolutely book it again with no hesitation!!!!

The view is as shown, with probably the best airport view in all of Las Vegas, and if you are a fan of music on weekends, you will get an unobstructed overhead view and listen of Wet Republic enjoying the artists without needing to dance in those murky waters. (It won't let you sleep in late, though!)\nThe fridge with ice-maker is clutch, as the ice-maker on the 31st floor was out of order (seems to happen a lot at MGM Signature), so we always had clean water and ice available in the room. Aside from the standard Signature furnishings, there were a dozen or so little touches of personalization from colour-changing LED lights, board games, to pieces of art not typically found in the room. And unlike other Signature units, pots, pans, plate settings for 4 etc. were all provided BEFORE checking into the suite, along with coffee supplies and other amenities.\nNot a lot of cleaning supplies were provided (Comet and dishwashing liquid, mostly) and we needed to supply our own paper towels, and there was a dishwasher but no dishwasher tabs -- but a drying rack for dishes was provided (also non-standard). For cooking supplies, you'll need to provide your own salt/pepper/oil etc, but spatulas, wooden spoons, salad bowls, etc. are provided.\nFor people staying first-time in Vegas in an MGM Signature suite, you might want to look at a 1-bedroom corner suite immediately adjacent to Kimia's for the incredible strip views. But once you've been to Signature once, you'll truly appreciate all the the things that Kimia has done to make her suite far more inviting, easier to check-in and easier to get your day started than any hotel-run or corporate-run suites provided here at Airbnb."", 'Our stay at Kimia‚Äôs MGM Signatures unit was great. The valet / check-in process was a breeze. The room location was great, as it‚Äôs an end unit with privacy. Upon arrival the room was clean and welcoming.

It was great to have a kitchen (we caught Lyft to a close grocery store and stocked up on day 1). And the setup of the space was excellent, with the children having their own bathroom, and us having some privacy in our own suite. It's a very modern unit, and decorated very nicely. And you really can't beat the location, as it's close enough to the strip (via the underground hallway) to get to everything, including the monorail, and yet just far enough away to have some quiet. Building 1 is better than 2 or 3 in my opinion because it is closer to the underground walkway. There's no smoking on these properties! That's huge! And the lazy river made this the best possible choice! It truly is the best lazy river we've ever done!\nKimia is an EXCELLENT host!

The balcony had great views of the mountains and the MGM grand, as well as the airport. We saw many flights come and go, so that was a cool experience. It was clean and comfortable. Really cool to have a place to cook and a full refrigerator. The only thing to note: The valet parking will close every evening when they are full or when they decide to close. This was sometimes 10pm, 8pm, and we saw it close at only 7pm one day. When this happens you have to take a shuttle from MGM grand‚Äôs parking garage to the Signature or you walk. If you plan to come and go throughout the evening, I do recommend using rideshare and leaving your car parked at self parking. The garage fills up fast so it will be quite a walk if you get stuck having to park towards the back of the building or on higher floors. The walk was about 2 blocks from parking once you‚Äôre out of the parking garage, so for some that is no big deal, but for others it could really cause strain on the vacation. You can walk outside or through the mgm grand all the way back to Tower 1, so there are options. I think walking outside is the shorter route though. All in all, great stay at the signature mgm and look forward to coming back in the future!', 'Just wonderful.\nBalcony was superb.', 'The penthouse was great.

First thing, is that this unit is bigger than the standard studio with a single bathroom. This unit has a closed off one bedroom with a huge bathroom and a separate living room that has a pullout couch with its own full bathroom. So it can easily sleep two couples or a small family with private sleeping areas. It‚Äôs a quick walk to the MGM Grand hotel and casino, which is connected with an air conditioned walkway.

We ubered and lyft to the strip every day we used XL since we were a large group and trips were usually $25-$30. It‚Äôs fairly easy to the strip, gas stations, restaurants, and grocery stores. The beds were super comfortable including the sofa bed. The kitchen is fully stocked with all the gadgets including kids dinnerware which was a huge plus for us. Both tvs were smart and great wifi. Everything was amazing. We hope to be back one day!!', 'Thank you to Rose for such a cozy and clean place.

We've got family in Vegas and next time we visit and want a place to relax on our own, we'll definitely book this house again!"", ""I had the opportunity to spend a week at Rose's place, and it went above and beyond my expectations. Now, I should disclose that I am an airbnb host since 2016 so it is impossible for me to write this review from the perspective as a guest alone. When I arrived, the house was in immaculate condition, professionally cleaned and sanitized. I was blown away by the amenities provided, the kitchen was stocked with everything you would need to cook a twelve course meal, every kind of pot/pan and utensil was there at my disposal, I have never seen anything like it. Check in and check out was streamlined and simple. Rose was extremely responsive to my messages and responded to any messages within an hour.\nThe house was also stocked with an abundance of towels, soap and shampoo, clean sheets with extra pillows if needed in the closets, and more. There was nothing I needed or fell short of, all I had to do was get some beverages to stock in the fridge and that was it. The house was very cozy, clean, and the neighborhood was quiet. The location of the house was great, I never had to go on the highway to get to the strip, I could just cut right through local streets with no traffic and get there in 10-15 minutes. I usually stay in the south side of vegas by red rock, so this was nice to save the extra 10 minutes of commute each way, which really makes a difference.\nI would say this house is well equipped for people who want to have a long term stay. A lot of airbnbs are empty, barebones and dont give you more than a few plates and some cups. I felt like I was in my own house here, the couches were cozy, really loved the recliner in the living room.\nDo NOT hesitate to book this place for your stay. Of all the Airbnb hosts I have encountered, Rose was the most proactive, kind, welcoming, and responsive that I have ever dealt with. As a host myself, I cant praise her enough! She is a shining example of what a ten star host is like.\nThe only thing that I would caution potential guests about is that the shower heads are quite low, I am just short of 6ft tall and I had to crouch down to get the water on my head from the shower head. This is the case with both bathrooms, so if you are someone over 6ft just keep in mind you will have to almost kneel down to get your hair wet. Other than that, there were no surprises. And this is not something I blame the homeowner for, they did not build the house, it is just something to keep in mind. Other than that, you can expect to have an amazing stay at Rose's house, don't hesitate to make your booking and get the best experience airbnb can offer."", 'My stay here was relaxing and comfortable. My husband, two sons, and I stayed here for a wedding trip. Love the location. The neighborhood was quiet and safe. Close to restaurants and supermarkets. 18-28 minutes away from strip. The host communicated well and was friendly. Very mindful of needed amenities and family would need during a four day stay. Felt like home away from home.', 'Rose was very friendly and left great instructions', 'It‚Äôs very great host', 'Well worth the being at the top of my list for future visits', 'Rose communicated very well. The house is not far from a Sprouts,Target -CVS just in case you forget something. It‚Äôs perfectly far enough from the strip you feel in a neighborhood but close enough when needing to go to the stadium like we did. It was experiencing Las Vegas in a different light! The house had all the amenities needed and everything was comfortable.', ""My friend and I were thrilled to have stayed here! The house was lovely, very cosy, and in a great area. Just a short drive to a million great food options (including grocery stores), we couldn't have stayed in a better location.\nThe house had all of the amenities you could want! Both of us were also working from home and had no troubles whatsoever.\nBeds are very comfortable too.\nThanks so much for having us!"", ""My wife and I stayed at Rose's home for nearly three months to escape the bitter Chicago winter.\nFrom our first point of contact, Rose was a kind, attentive, and generous host. One piece of evidence to attest to this is that Rose was graciously able to accommodate our request for an extra desk and chair for us to be able to work remotely during our time in Las Vegas. As for the home, it is outfitted with a wide array of cooking implements, storage containers, pots/pans/even a griddle!, etc. making it very well-equipped for those looking to do a long stay who are looking to make extensive use of the kitchen. The rest of the living arrangements are comfortable, and we especially enjoyed the proximity of the house to the local neighborhood park, which is just a short walk away, and to Las Vegas Chinatown and the broader Spring Valley surroundings, which had no shortage of grocery stores, delicious restaurants, bakeries, coffee shops and the like. Nothing was further than a 15 minute drive away (including the Strip)!\nIn terms of value, Rose's home is a proper standalone, single-family home with a drive-in garage and backyard. When compared to other properties that my wife and I were considering during the planning phase of our trip to Las Vegas, the only other places in the Spring Valley area that we saw that were comparable in cleanliness and amenities were much smaller apartment/condo spaces. Rose's home is the one to choose for those looking for more space and for the privacy that comes with staying in a single-family home.\nIf you are looking for a comfortable, well-outfitted home close to anything you might need or want, it's unlikely you could do much better than Rose's place!"", 'Rose communicated well and was easy to reach as needed. The house was clean and well stocked with kitchen items to feel at home. Stores, food, and coffee all within a 5 minute drive.', 'his was my second Visit and I\'m already looking forward to my 3rd and 4th. Everything was clean and ready when I arrived.

Definitely a recommended stay.', 'What a great place to stay for a trip to Vegas!', 'Great hosts and a great place overall. The beds are big and soft, the neighborhood is quiet. We slept great.\nOnly issue is water pressure in the shower is too weak for me, which can be easily fixed.\nThe hosts are good folks with great responsive communication. Had a minor issue and was resolved easily and amicably.\nDef recommend!', 'We stayed at Rose‚Äôs property for a little over a month. Everything about our stay was excellent. Nice house, good neighborhood and location, and the few times we reached out to communicate with Rose, she responded very quickly. Would definitely recommend staying here', 'Very quiet neighborhood, about 10-15 min drive from the strip, this is perfect for us. Super good and accurate communication with the host.

The beds were very comfortable and we were supplied with everything you would need during your stay.', 'Thank you so much!!', 'Very nice and comfortable house.

Rose is the best with communication and her property is just as described. This place is a home away from home and she makes sure you feel that way during booking, checking in, during your stay, and when you check out! I definitely would stay again as it‚Äôs an ideal place to stay in Vegas if you don‚Äôt want to be in the hustle of the bright lights of the strip. Her place is a $15 Uber/Lyft ride from the strip so it‚Äôs easy to leave your car parked safely in the garage at the house and not worry about driving in LV traffic or deal with parking.

For example, we asked to send us picture of the house or indicate any outstanding signals for us to identify the house as we arrived Vegas very late. The best response would be just sending us a picture or telling us there is a unit number in the front door. However, the team chose not to disclose any info.\n2) Communication wording should be improved. Messages indicate that the owner untrusted guests and eager for money. Example: ask if we want early check-in or extend stays; tell us $150/h penalty will be paid if late check-out.\n3) Fun fact: ask residents to clean out but they do not provide any trash bags.', 'A/C went out in the summer and got up to 83 degrees indoors while it was 115 degrees outside.

WiFi in our room was also not working, we called front desk and they sent someone within a couple hours to reboot the modem on the floor. Access to the laundry room would have been great since we were staying 5 days but the host stated we would have to stay the 7 days to have access to the laundry room.

It is super peaceful and great for decompressing after a long day/night on the Strip. Takes about 10 to 15 minutes to get to the Strip walking through MGM but only takes about 7 to get to The MGM Grand pool and monorail station. The room itself is a good sized suite with a pullout couch, king size bed (could have been comfier) kitchenette, fridge and bar. The huge shower and bathroom were a plus. The jacuzzi was loud but there are hot tubs on the property and at the grand so ü§∑\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏è The balcony and view are what really sell this place, great view of Hilton, Cosmo, Aria, PH, Horseshoe, Sig pools, and the mountains.

Their actions turned every moment into a heartfelt connection and a celebration of human kindness. Shared dinners and uplifting conversations instilled a unique sense of belonging and warmth within me.

There is self-parking as well, but it is down the block a bit further away since it is the parking building behind the MGM Grand. But they do have a way to walk through the MGM Grand and directly back to the Signature towers, so you don't have to walk in the hot sun just to get back to your room. We personally didn't mind it because we expected to walk around a lot in Las Vegas. To add onto that, the building is also in walkable distance from the Strip, which was a perk. There was only ever one issue during our stay, and it was that the TV wasn't working. It wasn't a huge issue since we were going to be out of the room lot, but we told the front desk anyway and they sent someone up very quickly to get it fixed for us.

Most definitely will be staying here whenever i return to Vegas!', ""My friend and I stayed over at Lulu's place for the week. The suite was very spacious and clean. The suite's walls are thick, so we didn't hear much noise from people staying in the surrounding suites during our stay. The place comes fully equipped with appliances you might need, such as pots, pans, a kettle, etc. Something to be mindful of is due to it being an Airbnb; the room only gets cleaned at the end of your stay despite it being a part of the hotel. I mention that because of the limited trash cans in the suite.\nAnother thing that we noticed was that the ice maker kept melting, causing the fridge shelves to be constantly soaked, so we had to bag all our groceries. During our stay as well, the hotel was undergoing maintenance, so the water was turned off from 11-2 for one of the days, and the escalator that leads you to the palm resort tower was broken the whole week, which would only affect you if you have a lot of luggage.

Ensure the name you use on Airbnb exactly matches your name on the id you provide to the hotel registration employee. ENSURE THE NAME YOU USE ON AIRBNB MATCHES YOUR NAME ON THE ID YOU PROVIDE TO THE HOTEL REGISTRATION EMPLOYEE. Other than that, my stay couldn't be better. Convenient location and the value is much better if you stay a week or longer versus regular hotel prices.

The surrounding neighborhood is a little sketchy but Amparo‚Äôs place felt safe.\nI have three improvement suggestions to make the stay perfect:\n1. Warn guests that the mattress is a SUPER firm/hard mattress and offer a memory foam mattress topper if you prefer a softer mattress. The first night was so uncomfortable we ended up buying a mattress topper at Target to use for the rest of the nights.\n2. Add curtains/shades to the windows between the bedroom l, living room and bathroom wall so that the light doesn‚Äôt come through when sleeping in the bedroom and someone is using the lights in the living room or bathroom.\n3.

I‚Äôd recommend anyone to stay here and will definitely rebook when I‚Äôm back.', 'My husband and I really enjoyed our stay here. It was nice to be away from the strip, but also still only a $20 Lyft ride away. We enjoyed the jacuzzi though we couldn‚Äôt figure out the projector, but that was ok. I will say the bed on the master is not comfortable. Not sure if it was the mattress or the bad frame the mattress was on, but it was a no for us. We switched to the room at the from of the house. Wasn‚Äôt a big deal for us because it was just us two, but something to keep in mind if you have a larger party staying here. Neighborhood is really quiet and even though we weren‚Äôt loud, It felt like we were too loud, lol. Overall we would definitely stay here again. House was clean, stocked with cookware, ice maker in the fridge, basic toiletries (hotel style), and first aid.', 'Jorge was extremely helpful and responded very quickly. The home was lovely and offered more space than I imagined.', 'This is an absolute jewel in the rough! 30 minutes from the airport, and 20 minutes from both the Las Vegas Strip and Summerlin featuring Red Rock, this is the best location for rest, relaxation and fun. The hot tub on the patio will keep you happy, day and night! Personally, I spent more time in the hot tub than in bed, but that‚Äôs the best part about vacations or staycations, just having the ability to relax in a safe and serene environment! No contact check in was sweet & simply, and Jorge is always a call or text away for any information needed. I highly recommend his home! If I could leave 10 stars, I would‚Ä¶ alas, Five Stars for the win! Many thanks!!!', 'I can‚Äôt wait to go back.', 'This house is a hidden gem in a nice quiet neighborhood - the photo‚Äôs do not do it justice. Everything is new and clean and soaking in the Hot Tub was an incredible way to cap off our long drive out from Southern California. The Beds and Furniture were all extremely comfortable with each bedroom (and the Hot Tub!) having its own Smart TV allowing us to stream our preferred service. The WiFi was very fast and reached everywhere in the house. The kitchen was fully stocked with new appliances and utensil and there is a grocery store just a few blocks away (walking distance).

It was nice seeing the residential part of Las Vegas. Jorge responds fast and brought us batteries very soon after we informed him the TV remote was dead and asked where we could find spare batteries. We did have a couple issues with cleanliness; the floors had been swept/vacuumed but definitely not mopped, as well as a couple other little cleanliness things. A few tips for future guests: k-cups for the Keurig are not provided and the hot tub needs to be turned on a few hours before use as it does not continually run.', 'Jorge was a great host!! I arrived earlier than expected and I reached out to Jorge and he allowed me to check in early he responded within minutes. The home was very clean and the neighbors were peaceful I felt right at home. The house looked even better than the pictures.

Kids and wife loved the place next time Visit to vegas i will definitely book again', 'Jorge‚Äôs spot was a quiet place away from the busyness of the Las Vegas strip. Perfect for our group of gals who didn‚Äôt want to be around all the crazy all the time. It was far enough to need a car or drive. Our only complaint was the hot tub wasn‚Äôt heated up when we got there and it took all of the first night to do so. We were looking forward to a long soak after our day of travel.', '3 of us stayed here for a ""guys weekend"" in Vegas. Perfect place for us. Backyard hot tub was perfect to relax in.\nGreat location in North Vegas. Close to chain restaurants and grocery stores (Smiths and Walmart were really close). 20 minutes to the Strip.\nJorge was really quick when responding to some of our questions.', 'A small group of us stayed here and we loved it!!

Jorge was responsive to the few messages that were sent. (i only had a few because the home was as advertised and we had zero issues once checked in.) I had miscalculated my arrival time due to time zones and Jorge allowed early checking to accommodate us. Great visit. When we return to Las Vegas I will be looking to see if this rental is available. Thank you Jorge for the hospitality.', 'It was fun', 'Quiet save feeling neighborhood. Great hot tub!', 'Perfect for a group stay! 3 bedrooms with closets and room to put your things. 2 bathrooms with showers and tubs. The kitchen is well stocked with all the things you need to make meals,and the layout of the house is great. If you are heading to the Strip or Freemont Street you will need a car ~ so rent one or you will need Uber, which works very well in Vegas. There is a hot tub big enough for 6 people and we felt very safe and secure in the neighborhood. The bedding was soft and we had enough towels! Thanks Jorge.', 'Jorge‚Äôs place is just perfect if you want to stay off the strip - everything was clean and as described - would definitely stay there again on my next Las Vegas visit.', 'The check in process was super easy and effortless. The host was very accommodating and was there any time I had a question. The house itself was gorgeous! I would live there if I had a house like that. It was more than enough space than what I needed it for and it felt like home. The value was actually less than a hotel. I went during March madness and spring break so the hotels were really pricey and this Airbnb gave me more space for my money. I will definitely stay again!', ""Jorge's place was an excellent vacation spot. My husband and I were in town for work. After a Long day of outdoor work it was absolutely wonderful to rinse off and get into the Jacuzzi. I was bummed that the TV over the Jacuzzi was not present like in the photo, but Jorge let me know that it had been recently damaged."", ""The place is beautiful and very clean.

Thanks again Jorge!', ""Our goal was to find a home that was close to a family member who lived in North Las Vegas. We didn't need to be close to the Strip but didn't want to be far from grocery stores and take-out places. And it needed to accommodate four adults. Jorge's place was the perfect fit.\nMy wife and I had our own room & bathroom, and our two college-age children had their own rooms and bathroom. The family room had a comfy couch that my wife fell asleep on multiple times. The dining room was the hub of the house and my daughter and I could do our computer work there. The washer and dryer came in handy midway through our trip. The only time we used the kitchen was to store our take-out food in the refrigerator and heat up hot water in the microwave. The internet signal was strong and my son was able to play his online games through the night with no lag.\nThere is a Smith's grocery store, Chipotle, and Dutch Bros. nearby. When I needed something sent from Amazon, there was a locker at the nearby Circle K. My son and I stumbled upon Mr. Fries Man and it was so good that we went there two days in a row.\nThe house is located in a quiet neighborhood. During our stay, I only saw one neighbor come out of his house.\nThis was the perfect home away from home. By the time we left, my family was sorry to leave. We look forward to staying here again on our next trip to Vegas."", 'Jorge‚Äôs place exceeded our expectations. There was a laundry room which we appreciated after the hot tub.

So much was provided to make this an easy trip and make it feel like home away from home. The next time we‚Äôre in Vegas we will definitely be booking here again.

I wouldn‚Äôt call it luxury but if you‚Äôre looking for a place off the strip but still close enough for convenience, this place will do the job.

There is some noise with people upstairs and walls are definitely not sound proof, as when people are outside coming and going you can hear everything. These are things the owner can‚Äôt control, and she is nice and quick to communicate. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs quieter than a casino hotel on the strip at least. Check in was a breeze- just a code for the lock.\nKitchen is stocked with anything you‚Äôd need if you wanted to make some meals there, although we didn‚Äôt so I can‚Äôt really say how the appliances work.\nThe place wasn‚Äôt spotless but it was clean enough for my comfort level- I gave it a 4 out of 5 for cleanliness. There were cleaning supplies there for a few things I felt needed to be cleaned a bit better, namely the tub, but for the most part it was acceptable, just sort of disappointing when you‚Äôre paying an $85 cleaning fee. Sheets and towels were clean and fresh, and the washer and drier are nice to have- with detergent provided as well.\nOverall an okay value for the money.. might be worth it more during the hotter season since there are pools that my husband walked by and said they looked really nice. We also walked to Palms casino and it only took us about 15 minutes. There‚Äôs also Walgreens, Denny‚Äôs, Chick-fil-a and a few other places within the same distance. It was nice out that day so we also walked to the strip from Palms and it took us about 30 minutes, so it‚Äôs maybe about a 20 minute walk from the condo.

You can request anything you may need from the iPad in the room or through the front desk (plates, utensils, etc). Unfortunately, the refrigerator did NOT work.

The room is on floor 32. Freeway I-15 is on the left, so there's a constant low droning traffic noise, which didn't bother us.\nMy comments are about the hotel and its location. There is no casino. The elevator is only a few feet from the front door. In many LV hotels you need to trek forever through the smoky casino to the back to get the elevator to your room. If you have a car, there's a back road leading to the hotel. You can drive to/from it without being anywhere near the insanely crowded Las Vegas Strip. The hotel is connected to Aria, Bellagio, and Cosmopolitan, allowing good access to the Strip. The pool is not deep but is large enough. There's not loud music blasting in the background.

The location perfect, gated community and was close enough for a short uber but far enough to be quiet. The room does need some love since there were some minor fixes to be done.

To be fair, the biggest oversight I made was that I did not know an animal would be on the premises and I am not a fan of any house pet. That was my bad and unfortunately it made my stay not as enjoyable as I would have liked since I like a peaceful environment to come home to especially after a long day out and about on vacation or in this case when I have to be up and out very early in the morning. So note my rating is based on my overall experience not on the place itself.\nThe place itself is great. Love having the private bathroom, access to laundry and kitchen. The pool was great and although I never made it to the gym, 24 hour access is awesome.\nThe location is also very convenient as I did not travel more than 15min in an Lyft/Uber to get around. I am not a fan of the strip so I did a lot of local exploring. I didn't feel unsafe in the neighborhood and there are plenty of grocery and restaurants within walking distance. Just make sure you remember the gate code and direct Lyft/Uber on how to get to the complex.

Sorry, I didn't read these messages until we were on site (my mistake!).\nSince Abby was not at home, we sat 30 minutes in front of the apartment. Upon request, she informed us how to get into the apartment. In my opinion, a host who is not at home should inform their guests in advance about how to check in - not only on request after 30 minutes of waiting.\nThe next morning there were artisans in the apartment at 8am. After repeatedly knocking on the apartment door, they just entered the apartment. (Abby wasn't home, and we didn't want to open the door to anyone.)

We really enjoyed our stay.', 'Great location, Great views!!', 'I enjoyed my stay while at this suite. The balcony had a nice view of the strip. The hotel is a little bit of walking distance from the main strip but nothing too bad. I also liked the fact it was easy to get to the MGM Grand without having to go outside.\nI will say, the plumbing in the master bathroom was slow including the dual sinks, toilet, & shower. Other than that, I had a pleasurable stay and the host was very friendly and responsive.', 'Great stay. Beautiful room and views. Host was very responsive. We loved it!', 'Amazing homey cozy condo! We felt safe by having to use our room key to access our floor! The condo was spotless with every single amenity that was listed on the listing. Alex was responsive within minutes with any questions we had. We loved the balcony views and being able to see the Sphere out of the bedroom windows! We visit Las Vegas often and we with most definitely be staying at this property again!!! Thank you Alex we appreciate it!', 'Perfect location! Loved having two full bathrooms. Room was quiet. Great stay', ""MGM Signature is a great place to stay while in Las Vegas.l The suite is nicely furnished, location was GREAT, the jacuzzi bathtub. Note, it is a corner suite so there is little or no noise.\nGuest need to remember this is an AIRBNB, you do not get normal hotel amenities (you can at an extra charge, I needed my money for gambling :)), no coffee refills, no fresh towles etc, so pack accordingly.\nI'll stay there again for next years WAC tournament.\n\nGO AGGIES!\nDarlene Stacher"", 'We really enjoyed our stay. Beautiful views, comfortable space, Alex was easy to work with. Would happily stay again.', 'Nice place. Nice host.', 'Better than expected.

Would definitely book again!', 'The place was very clean. Communication was easy.', 'We always love our visit here as the unit and MGM pool complex are always great!', ""it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. There was a jetted tub that I sterilized 4 times before it was clean, and quick blowing black stuff out. It's obvious the carpets have not seen a steam clean in a while, if ever. The kitchen has basic stuff, but we had to get dish clothes and drying towels and a cookie sheet. They were alwaysresponsive and communicated well, even though yo were dealing with a corporation, and not an individual. In my opinion, it was decent enough, but it certainly wasn't worth the price. (note).....this was When We Were Young festival weekend, so everything was outrageous. But still, it didn'tlive up to the cost, on any occasion. Might stay here again in pinch, but nothing I would book as a first choice."", 'Perfect View for the New Years Fireworks! My Love Loved the Sphere View! Had a Wonderful Time! Clean and Neat!

Loved the PH floor.', '5-star host was amazing and very responsive. He provided all the information I needed to check in and out of the unit. Only downside is MGM. Their pool was small and overcrowded. You have access to the lazy river at MGM Grand but they make you bring / pay for your own float - first time I went to a lazy river that didn‚Äôt offer you a float as a hotel guest. Parking is handled through valet and they are slow so plan accordingly.

Very clean and quiet located on the penthouse floor in tower 2 awesome amenities and amazing view of the strip and of the mountains. The place is conveniently located as advertised. Communication and response time was quick and thorough. Plenty towels provided and items provided to cook your own food which is something that my husband and I enjoy most. Eating out daily can get expensive and heavy on the stomach and weight lol. They don't allow HDMI hookup onto their TV. We like to watch Netflix and Prime during our downtime. This is not permitted, however they do provide movie rental options for a cost and have free cable channels. Valet gets full and most times we had to park in the MGM public parking and walk 10 minutes to tower. They should consider having some type of shuttle service to transport from the signature to the MGM parking garage. The walk can be very long after a great night of drinking and dancing.

It was my first Airbnb booking and all I can say is it was perfect! Communication is on point. You will have a reply under an hour. Listing and description on point. Check-in was extremely easy. You don't even have to deal with the host on-site. The specific room I was staying had a beautiful view and it was the perfect price for a 4 night stay durning EDC weekend. For my girlfriend and I it was perfect and more then enough. Nothing but the best things to say about this host and this listing. I plan on booking through them moving forward!"", 'The unit was great value for the space and location. It was nice to have the living room and second bathroom (the primary bathroom was huge!). It was a 10 minute walk from the towers to the main MGM casino complex and about a 15 minute walk to Aria/City Center (for reference). The tower itself has a pool area and a cafe serving breakfast and lunch items, only open until 6pm.\nThe host was quick to reply to questions and it was nice to have things like extra towels and plenty of bath products.\nThe tower is approx 17 years old and it is starting to show its age. Also the parking situation can be a pain. While free, on Saturday there was a line over 10 minutes long to enter the Signature complex only to get to the guard house and find out the valet parking was full. You then had to drive to the main MGM hotel self parking lot then walk the 15 minutes back to the Signature. So in total, a 30 minute parking ordeal! Plan accordingly!\nAll said, I would definitely stay again.', 'Great view! Lots of space. Enjoyed our stay.', 'The place is conveniently located and as advertised. Communication throughout could be a little better. We had an issue with authorized guests on the Airbnb not being able to access the unit on check-in, and when the issue was reported, it was three hours before receiving a response.', 'This place was outstanding! It‚Äôs the hotel experience at a fraction of the cost. The view was wonderful and no issues with sound despite constant construction outside.

Great location', 'If ur not staying here, u might as well not come to Vegas.', 'Best place to be in the mix of the Vegas strip. Especially being close to the gym, very nice as well.\nOnly thing was gratuity each time valet vehicle.', 'Absolutely wonderful stay! Price does not compare to the beautiful patio/bedroom/kitchen! The complimentary valet service was delightful! The most valuable part to me was not only being close to the strip, is the fact that the entrance is in an area which avoids all the traffic! I will definitely choose to stay here again when I come back to Vegas!', 'Great place thank you!', ""Incredible stay! This unit is very comfortable, and spacious enough for everyone. It's in a great location facing towards the strip so you can see the Cosmopolitan, Aria and others. The kitchen is fully equipped with everything you need, and everything is clean. Having two bathrooms is a bonus! And the bathroom in the bedroom is huge with a jet tub and even a small TV. There are extra pillows and blankets in the closet. Check in was super smooth, and there is an enclosed walkway that takes you straight to the MGM Grand Hotel & Casino (~5min walk). The MGM Signature is my new home away from home. You're close enough to everything, but far enough to where you can escape from all the hustle & bustle and don't have to smell lingering casino cigarette smoke all night! I love it here. Plus the Miracle Mike Shops & Nacho Daddy are only a few walking blocks down the street :)"", 'Excellent stay!!', ""great place and very comfortable, checking in was a little slow, very good location close to everything, only problem i had was that 2 of the burners in the stove were not working properly, but i advised the staff and spoke to julia and she was very helpful and try to fix the problem by getting maintenance to go a check the problem, ( it was not fixed during our stay) but it didn't bother us too much since most of our stay we ate out . definitely wouldn't mind staying here again. üòÅüëç"", 'Second time staying at one of their Airbnb‚Äôs. Would recommend it and come back again next time we visit Vegas.', 'An excellent place! I would definitely come back', 'Had a great stay!', 'This was by far the best Vegas room I have stayed in. It did NOT have that sketchy hooker banging drug snorting feel to it that most Vegas rooms have. 33rd penthouse floor makes you feel important. We thought it was clean. The balcony has a better view than the listed photo. And in the bedroom you have a view of the sphere. Having a kitchen is awesome so you don‚Äôt have to eat out every meal. It‚Äôs technically on the strip, Since there is a enclosed walk way to the main MGM casino. About a 10min walk to Las Vegas blvd.\nWe walked to allegiant stadium, took about 50 min. Enough to get a good buzz before the game.\nThe only thing I thought was BS was the $55 1pm 2 hour early check in fee. Yes I agreed to pay it but I think there should be a little understanding to help your customers that fly in and have baggage ‚Ä¶ 3pm is late ‚Ä¶.\nOverall would I stay here again: Absolutely', 'this was a great location..... beautiful view', 'place was great, beautiful view and the use of the mgm grand definitely made it worth it', 'We rented this space for our trip to Vegas for a friends wedding.

Super spacious and modern!', ""really enjoyed our recent stay at Alex's place and will stay again. standouts were the very courteous check-in staff, cleanliness, and how well the place actually matched the listing. Alex was also readily available and responsive. things I might improve would be a couple of housekeeping issues, and the $100 per day amenity fee. it was refunded after we checked out, but there really were no snacks, minibar or other fungibles but it would cover."", 'Place was excellent, clean and as described. Highly recommended', 'Alex‚Äôs place is exactly like the pictures. Loved the entire house. It‚Äôs a suite room in a hotel, with kit hen amenities. It‚Äôs connected internally with MGM Grand which gives you access to a lot of the hotel amenities.\nThere are only 2 suggestions that I think would make this place even better, provide a washer and dryer for people who stay for more days and provide basic non perishable grocery like salt, sugar, pepper, etc so that the guests can do basic cooking.\nSince I stayed a longer period I wished these 2 amenities were there.', 'Clean, as described. No issues, seamless check in. 10/10 reccomend', 'Great place to stay!', 'Amazing stay will definitely be the first place I look any time I visit Vegas!', 'Very quick response, worth every penny.

Condo was clean except for the outdoor balcony, which had cob webs and was dusty. The pool is beautiful and it was nice to have a small onsite gym. Easy to get Uber/Lyft (has designated pick-up spot in front of the clubhouse/gym). Tong sent many proactive communications/rules, but did not come across as personable or flexible. I am a digital nomad and needed to check out 1 hour late due to a mandatory work meeting, but Tong said she couldn't allow that. That really put me in a bad spot.

If you plan on doing your own cooking, you will need to shop for things like spices and cooking oil, but there are plenty of grocery stores available right up Flamingo. I have only two quibbles: 1) it would be nice to have a small nightstand on the closet side of the bed (there is one on the other side; I brought a chair in to act as one) 2) Hosts at this complex should give precise direction on how to find the unit as the numbering system is a little odd. As many times as I have stayed at this complex, it is still a small adventure to find a unit.\nAll in all, I hope to stay at this unit every time it is available for when I am in town for conferences. It is immaculate and very comfortable and the many small touches are a delight to the road warrior."", 'This place is close to the strip but also far enough that you can experience some silence.

We were in town to visit friends and they were less than 5 minutes away. All of the tourist activities we wanted to do were within a 20 minute drive.\nMy only suggestions for improvement are individualized to my husband and myself, so I didn't think it necessary to detract a star. One suggestion is to upgrade the TV to something universal. Neither the husband nor I have Apple products so we weren't able to use the TV at all. Not a huge deal since we had plenty of things to do, but we are used to falling asleep to TV noise, which we could not do. The other thing was that the bed was very hard. That's probably perfect for some folks, but for those that are used to memory foam or something along those lines, it is quite jarring.

Will stay with them again. Thank you!!', ""My stay definitely met my expectations, the host was very prompt with responses, safety is one of the things that concerns me the most, Breezy's place fits the bill starting with the check in process with the security officers on duty at the time, to seeing security officers patrolling the grounds to security cameras located throughout the entire complex. We felt safe the entire time we stayed which was ten knights. I would strongly recommend Breezy's place and when I am back in Vegas I will try to rent from Breezy again if available."", 'I will find it again. It was a very satisfying trip with convenient facilities.', ""Overall they're complex is quiet. However there is overhead helicopter traffic and in the back of the complex there are train tracks.

The unit comes equipped with an in-unit washer and dryer, which is a nice added feature. However, guests may experience some noise issues during their stay. The unit is situated next to the train tracks, and this can result in noise from passing trains throughout the day and night. Moreover, there is consistent noise from the upstairs unit, particularly construction work during the day and stomping noises from what I assume is the upstairs resident at night. This is a common complaint among previous guests. Despite this, our stay was generally pleasant, although it would have been better if the noise issue was mentioned beforehand."", 'The hosts were very thoughtful and quickly responsive!

It is of no fault of the owners, but it may be great to add specific directions to where to find the apartment, in the instructions, when the code is provide. Just a thought.\nIt is walking distance to the Rio Hotel BUT walking is on a very busy street and I would not recommend it. We took an Uber to the strip for $15.00 to Bellagio and walked around the strip (around 6:00pm) - there is a safe area for pick up at the front of the condo complex. The return fee from the strip back to the condo was $21 (around midnight) from The Bellagio, and they dropped us in front of the apartment building for safety.\nI would recommend this place and would stay again.', 'Very great will come back for sire', 'Very clean quiet friendly the host was very responsive i give it a 10 out of 10', 'Great place to stay not far from main strip walkable distance but not to close to where you are crowded and cluttered by people loved the stay', 'Comfortable and convenient', 'Amazing place to stay!

It is in a gated community, so I definitely did not feel unsafe. While I wouldn't say it's totally walkable to the strip, with some maneuvering, you can still make it on foot. While the place was clean and cozy, the only issues we had was the noise. These are apartments, so expect to hear loud noise from upstairs neighbors walking around, doing laundry, etc. It wouldn't have been an issue during the daytime, but this particular unit and neighbor we could hear all through the night. My partner is very noise sensitive, so most nights it was difficult for her to sleep. One morning the upstairs neighbor was doing laundry and it was really loud (the machines) I did bring it up to the host and they responded right away. There's also the train, while nothing can be done about that, it is a pretty loud factor.

We were in town to visit friends and they were less than 5 minutes away. All of the tourist activities we wanted to do were within a 20 minute drive.\nMy only suggestions for improvement are individualized to my husband and myself, so I didn't think it necessary to detract a star. One suggestion is to upgrade the TV to something universal. Neither the husband nor I have Apple products so we weren't able to use the TV at all. Not a huge deal since we had plenty of things to do, but we are used to falling asleep to TV noise, which we could not do. The other thing was that the bed was very hard.

The host had to do it on the spot because she must have forgotten, so it took about 1hr and bit more for us to finally get our room, therefore the plans we made were pushed back. The set up of the room was nice and clean, it also has a kitchen provided with utensils. Main issue we had was no hot water for showering (1st day 4:30PM, 2nd day 11:30PM), took them about 1hr-2hrs to have it fix.

I will note, though, that if you're like us and looking to save a buck by finding cheaper deals on a place to stay rather than staying close to the Strip, you WILL pay out the nose for rideshares to get pretty much anywhere from here. Think $25 one-way to get to a casino from this place. If you bring/rent your own car or aren't planning to go back and forth from the Strip every day, this is a great deal, but if you plan to use Lyft/Uber, it's probably cheaper and easier to just stay closer to the Strip. This isn't to snub this cute little place, just some general advice regarding location. For this place itself, the only downside is that the sofa bed was pretty hard and uncomfortable.

The cleanliness and attention to detail were superb, and the welcome note gave for a nice touch!

I found the Wi-Fi very good to me when I was watching a live streamed event. The refrigerator being in the bedroom made me lol and probably could be annoying to some who are actually making food as I was but I didn‚Äôt find it to cumbersome. If I had anything to nitpick, the bathroom while luxurious is quite small, I‚Äôm a tall guy so my elbows tended to bump into random things but it didn‚Äôt bother me. I was here for an event at the Mandalay Convention Center and the drive was very easy back and forth, my needs were met overall.

A dog startled me from the other side of the fence when I checked in, which you can‚Äôt see through, but it was quiet when I came back later at night, it was good to know that there was extra security on the property though. There was a charger dock there that seemed to work at first but eventually my phone was dead, so I used the block that it was plugged into, which really saved me!

While I really cannot complain about our suite and all facilities and amenities were great, I got into trouble due to lack of guidance on parking through the texts. The host did mention that the valet parking was subject to availability, however, little could I get that even if I had the availability during check-in, the parking spot would not remain reserved for me for the entire duration of my stay. Consequentially, I lost the parking spot after we had come back from the city tour, and had to park at another location which was at a 10/15-minute walking distance. Next day morning I asked the front desk why I wasn't informed during check-in that I could still lose the valet parking spot even after check-in if I took my car out. The lady said their website did mention this, and since my booking was through Airbnb, there might have been a gap in communication.

The unit was modern and spacious and pretty clean. The host went out of their way to make out stay enjoyable and was extremely quick to reply to any questions that I had. One thing I would say (nothing to do with the place or the host) is that the supermarkets in Las Vagas are expectedly expensive and have poor selection. However, there is one called Smiths about a half hour walk away that has fair prices and a good selection. Just thought that might be helpful to anyone staying in Las Vagas as we went to target and regretted not knowing about Smith's earlier! Would definitely stay here again if I were to come back; can't really fault it :)"", 'This Airbnb was amazing! After a long day i was so excited to go sleep in the comfortable bed.

We felt safe with the gate guards on duty 24/7. Quick eats and convenience stores nearby.

Xu is a great host and provides clear instructions on check in and out. No resort fees and laundry provided is a plus!

Place was mostly clean but we did see one cockroach and some leftover hairs in the bathroom.', 'We spent 3 nights, and overall it was great! It‚Äôs close to both the strip and Fremont so Lyft rides were reasonably priced. The Hottub and pool were also a great added bonus!

I had a little bit of trouble finding exactly which condo it was when I first arrived but it was also dark. The decor was simple and cute. For the most part it was clean, there just could have had a little more attention in the bathroom. It is noisy but then again it is a big city. We could hear footsteps from other apartments, people closing doors, there was a train, and when the heater would come on it would make me jump thinking someone was trying to come in the door. Xu was very quick to respond, even when it was late. At like 11:00 I had a question about getting dropped off and X·ª© responded quickly.

It was worth every penny.', 'I don\'t give poor ratings lightly... this is the first I have ever given on AirBnB that wasn\'t 5 stars. However, there were so many issues I believe it warrants it and I don\'t want someone else to have the same issues we did.\nFirst, the front door. It barely latched/secured, and even with the deadbolt engaged you could see daylight all around it and it wasn\'t securely fit. We felt uncomfortable and unsafe the whole time.\nNext, it wasn\'t AirBnB clean. I mean, it was ""clean"", but by bachelor standards. Floorboards showed obvious lack of regular cleaning. Stains of some sort near lamp in bedroom. The side of the fridge was totally gross, and this isn\'t us pulling the fridge out and looking behind it... it\'s simply what takes 1 minute to do a bit of proactive work on cleaning. Sink had stains... the whole ""feel"" was not the normal very clean I\'m used to in AirBnB.\nBiggest issue... bugs! I can\'t 100% confirm they were roaches, but we found them in the bathroom and kitchen numerous times.', 'I absolutely enjoyed being at XU‚Äôs property ! The neighborhood was very secure & super close by the strip ! There‚Äôs even a Walgreens right across the street that does sell alcohol.

Thank you !', ""was nice other than having to pay 20 dollars for a towel that I couldn't even be told what was on it to cause a stain after it was washed by staff, also had to kill 3 bugs in the bathroom"", 'I spent Christmas with my granddaughter here and we had everything we needed ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è', ""Xu's place had a ton of stuff we needed. The addition of a laundry machine and a dryer is a god send in Vegas. The best thing about our stay was that Xu was incredible responsive for us. I liked that the bathroom had shampoo, conditioner, and soap dispensers drilled into the walls. This place was decent enough for us to stay a few nights.\nThere are some gripes I had with this space: the sofa bed was a bit uncomfortable. My friend and I had to switch off sleeping on it to share the discomfort. There was also some pest insect that showed up occasionally in the bathroom every few days which we would squash. This place is clean but I did have some concerns upon seeing the pests.\nOther than that, the Roku TV works great. The shower is okay. There are laundry supplies for you to wash your clothes. We had a lot to like here so we enjoyed our time. Some of the things that bothered us a lot are outside the owner's control like the railroad being loud close to the apartment"", ""the place was as described. we also found coffee, sugar, cream, tea... for our breakfast.

Coffee maker had used tea bags in it. Found cosmetics on the floor. One TV out of 3 worked, many of the lights didn't work, wall plug was partially detached from the wall & sheets had blood stains. Blackout curtains were full of holes and hanging off the rail. This is just a sample or deficiencies - too many to list. The owner was dishonest, she said she contacted check in desk, which they firmly denied wasn't the process. Only contact was thru AirBnb which got straightened out. Suite not as described in listing. Avoid this place, looks great but NOT! Don't ruin your Vegas vacay. Don't book with this host. It's all about money to her. Working with airbnb to resolve."", 'I enjoyed my stay at Leanne.

There are 2 Palms buildings and 1 Palms Place building. Goo gle maps took us to one of the Palms buildings so after wandering through the casino and waiting a while to check in, I discovered I was in the wrong building (it‚Äôs the Palms Place building), but I was able to check in there. Overall I think it took over an hour to check in and make it to our room because of just a lack of clear instruction.\nAs we walked into our room, there was a cockroach on the bathroom counter that must have crawl up through the drain.\nAlso one of the bathroom faucet handles kept falling off. Wasn‚Äôt a big deal, just annoying.\nOverall the place wasn‚Äôt bad.

Although you don‚Äôt get access to the balcony which sucks but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs for a good reason. Just a few things that I wasn‚Äôt too happy about was the trash in the bathroom. I found dried up color contacts and hair clips on the floor. Also, all the shelving/desk area along the wall was extremely dusty. I just think the cleaning crew need to make sure everything is clean.
