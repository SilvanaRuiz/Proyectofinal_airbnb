We wanted to try all the amazing food of Austin, so we dined out every meal. But, if we had wanted to cook there, the kitchen had everything we would have needed. We messaged with Lauren & Chad prior to our stay and they always got right back to us. Very communicative. We love that in a host. We liked the keypad entry and alarm. It felt very safe.

I would note that the unit we stayed in was ground level, so if anyone is upstairs you can hear them, but overall this wasn’t really too much of an issue for us.', 'Gorgeous home and very walkable location.

We were able to get in and out of the west side of downtown super easily and then once at the AirBnb we were able to walk to some of our favorite east side restaurants and bars.

The water pressure is non-existent and the pull out is not very comfortable... The AC is right above the pull out so it at least stays cool in that area but would really benefit from upgrading the current pullout to one that is more comfortable!

So close to so much fun. Great clean cool apartment. Definitely stay here.', 'I enjoyed my stay at Daniels. i thought the location was great as we mostly stayed & hung out on the east side of Austin. everything is very walkable, we only ubered 3 times during our week stay due to the rain one day & to & from the airport. i was disappointed about the large industrial construction going on literally next door. i felt like i couldn’t open the curtains & it was extremely loud. i understand the host isn’t responsible for what happens outside his property but i think it would have been nice to know. host was extremely responsive & helpful, even accommodating an early check in & had a place to drop bags if you wanted to leave before the place was ready. i also think the itinerary book should be updated as there were at least 4 places listed that don’t actually exist anymore. (i’m glad i looked them up online before we left or that wouldn’t have been cool) all in all a good cozy place to stay.', ""We enjoyed Daniels placed very much The location was perfect--we were in town visiting our daughter who was very close by so the placed couldn't have been better located.

There’s restaurants and bars within a blocks walk and the major part of 6th street is about a mile away. I literally have no complaints. The host was super responsive. However, would only say that there’s a BBQ grill in the pictures that’s no longer there. The host stated that it was damaged by previous guests and not replaced by the insurance company. I understand but I checked in on the 4th of July and had already stopped at the store to buy things to bbq before the firework show before checking in so I had to change my plans and go to a restaurant.

The location for me was beyond perfect for our 1 night in Austin since west 6th street was right there and walkable for a fun night out. Airbnb had everything the 2 of us could want.

An easy walk to some nice restaurants and easy to grab an Uber to downtown. Nice clean place.\nCons: Weird bathroom arrangement with the toilet in a closet and the shower in another closet. There is no bathroom sink, you have to use the kitchen sink. There is no good mirror for putting on makeup or shaving and terrible light to do the same.\nThe wall air conditioner is in the toilet and has to be accessed by standing on the toilet to adjust the settings.\nLastly, the TV instructions are very strange (I am a techie and I couldn’t get it working right and it is placed terribly to be ble to actually watch it.\nOverall, an OK experience, but not great.', 'It was such a cool spot for one person or a couple.

Easy check in.', 'If this backyard guest house is available - book it ASAP!\nWe absolutely loved staying at this little mid-century guest house in west Austin.

Everything is labeled and very clear and the hosts have incredible communication! Hosts were responsive, so helpful, and clearly love their space.\nThe guesthouse is nestled in a beautiful backyard that has a secret garden vibe and is absolutely lovely. The area is walkable and has A LOT of great spots to hit. We recommend Clark’s, Better Half, Hold Out Brewing, and Rosie’s - all easily walkable. When didn’t get a chance to try Lin’s, but it’s first on our list for our next trip to Austin. Ubers and Lyfts were accessible and easily found us. I truly do not have enough great things to say about this space and will recommend it to anyone heading to Austin!!', 'We are Austinites and used Peter’s guest cottage as a staycation. It is set in a beautiful garden behind a historic home and upon walking in there were fresh oranges, snacks, and water provided. The phenomenal local radio station was playing and there was a guide that had been put together for those not familiar to Austin. It felt like a beautiful retro time capsule complete with a delightful collection of books and it is hyper walkable to some of the best restaurants in town. We plan to stay here again soon.', 'This was a great place for my girlfriend and dog and I when we stayed in Austin. We were close to many attractions and there was plenty of space for the 3 of us. There was also good air conditioning which was helpful when we wanted to get out of the Texas heat.', 'Everything was excellent.

Main house is gorgeous! Very close to Austin. Highly recommend this little place', ""This is a peaceful setting within a walled garden in a lively, walkable neighborhood. The photos don't lie about one quirk - the kitchen sink is the only sink. Hosts are eager to please, amenable to suggestions, as it's a new listing. It's within an Historic District, but Austin is booming, so one can see the changing landscape and how new construction is being sandwiched into old neighborhoods. The listing is close to West Austin Park and a reasonable walk to get to Ladybird Lake. Coffee & pastries - Medici Roasting on West Lynn or Swedish Hill nearby on Sixth. Lunch/dinner - more than a dozen diverse choices nearby, no car required."", 'We had a wonderful stay! Such a beautiful yard. The guesthouse is cozy and well appointed. The location can’t be beat.

Made me wonder if the place had a history with an interesting story. Neighborhood is very quiet, yet walkable to many restaurants and bars with easy access to downtown and the west side. We appreciated a designated parking spot and being able to bring our dog and have a yard for her to explore. The area felt safe during our morning walks. While the bathroom setup was not an issue for us, I recommend checking it out before you come as it is very tight quarters in the shower and toilet “closets”, and the kitchen sink doubles as the bathroom sink. The bed was comfortable, and the provided seating adequate for our needs as we were out most of the day. Our host was friendly and very prompt in responding to our questions, and the process for check-in was clear and easy. We will likely consider this property again for short stays in Austin.', 'Peter’s guest house was incredible! It was very comfortable, cozy, and clean.

Use of this space and attention to detail was fabulous. Gorgeous architecture. Truly appreciated having few snacks and sampler of few bottled waters, sparkling beverages in the fridge upon arrival (not expected, but so nice when you're just arriving somewhere) Coffee maker (w/coffee &filters) Bed comfy. Towels, dish soap, some toiletries, everything we needed. Perfect for couple or if in town for an event; location can't be beat. Backyard is beautiful, private, great space to sit outside and read.

From the MCM décor, a super-comfy bed, and a delightful outdoor area to enjoy, it will certainly be on our list for return trips to the area.

It’s just right. The lighting and design inside is amazing. And the yard outside is so so beautiful to sit and have a coffee and read. The hosts were amazing, helpful, friendly and so responsive. So grateful we booked this space and for the experience we had. No complaints. 5/5!!! 🌟', 'We had a terrific stay here. We loved the location, the privacy, and the historical neighborhood / architecture. The guest house was spacious and comfortable, and the courtyard and garden were lovely (and a great bonus for morning coffee while our little dog played). There’s a full sized kitchen, but we hardly used it since we took our host’s OUTSTANDING suggestions regarding fantastic eateries that were just steps away. Despite being so close to fantastic Austin hot spots, it is quiet here and so peace and rest are easy. The guesthouse is as pictured, but those pictures don’t capture how cozy and classic the space is. Also, as pictured, the toilet and shower are literal water closets, but that’s no deal breaker for us with this cool place and excellent location. We will be back!', 'Great spacious and cozy guesthouse. Host was very accommodating and friendly. I would recommended staying for for anyone!', 'Great space and awesome location.', 'This was the perfect place for us and our doggy for our short visit in Austin.

We had everything we needed and Peter was responsive via text. I thought it was very private despite being a back house. Would definitely recommend this spot and we’d stay here again in a heartbeat!', ""Peter/Shannon's place is great. We felt it was larger than the pictures suggested which is always a plus. The toilet room and shower are kind of small, but they get the job done. The place is cute and cozy, TV is in a great spot to watch and unwind after a long day/night, the backyard is amazing and there is a parking spot in the driveway right by the gate to enter the backyard to the guesthouse. The kitchen sink doubles as your bathroom sink just an FYI. The space has all the appliances you may need and is a quick walk (few minutes) from a couple restaurants and coffee shop - very convenient. Overall, we would stay here again - we planned to bring our dogs and love that the yard would have been a great dog friendly area but didn't end up bringing them.""]",['2 guests · Studio · 1 bed · 1 bath'],https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/813139795405307933?adults=1&children=0&enable_m3_private_room=true&infants=0&pets=0&search_mode=regular_search&check_in=2024-11-10&check_out=2024-11-15&source_impression_id=p3_1729616477_P3YIP6lBLhEMw03W&previous_page_section_name=1000&federated_search_id=bb8e6898-b5ff-4b7a-ac11-c9e061d89d15

We walked most of the time and never once felt unsafe, even after leaving a show after 1am on campus.\nThe apartment itself is flexible, the couch and bed are both fairly comfy enough, and the bathroom is INCREDIBLY well-stocked. We didn't use the kitchen, but it looked decent. The TV has all kinds of options, though sometimes it struggled with the internet connection--it improved somewhat when we moved the flat white antenna out from behind the TV. I personally preferred to keep the blinds in the bedroom closed at all times since those windows look directly into those of other apartments, but other than that, we didn't have any issues with neighbors.

However there were plenty of other things like oil, salt, pepper and condiments etc. that we did not have to buy, that was nice. The Beds were great! We ended up using both the fold out couch and the bed and it was great. The only issue we could say we had was the noise on the 2nd night of which we were surprised but we communicated to Omar and he responded, but we knew it was out of his control (Texas won B-Ball game @March Madness)so we thanked him for trying to do what he could.

I hope to stay here again next time I'm in Austin."", 'Omar’s place is in a great location and it’s very comfortable and welcoming. There were lots of “extras” in case I forgot anything. The entire house was well equipped. Check-in & out were very easy. Omar was quick to respond when I messaged him and very helpful. I would recommend this apartment to anyone.', 'I enjoyed my stay here. The host was super responsive and there’s a wonderful park nearby for your evening walks. Since it’s close to the university the place has so much energy with many amazing restaurants at walking distance.', 'Good central location & good communication with host.', ""I was satisfied with the apartment especially considering the cost. The kitchen was very functional and I was able to cook full meals without any difficulty. Shower was very good. Hot water was hot and water pressure strong. Bedding was comfortable and clean. Lots of linens which I appreciated. Plenty of towels, blankets, sheets, pillows, etc. All decent quality. I slept on the sofa bed. I believe it was a foam mattress but I could be mistaken. Regardless, it was very comfortable. My son slept in the bedroom. Bed was big and he said it was good. Bedroom was quite large with a desk and closet space for clothing. TV was decent and had access to all apps. I watched Starz on owner's account and used my own account for Hulu. IMDB available along with other channels. No problems with internet. We stretched out while watching tv on the sectional. Didn't see any bugs and that was nice. Area is good. Walked most mornings and really enjoyed it. I think this place is a good value and if you stay there please don't forget to feed the kitties who live nearby and visit under the steps."", ""I recommend this airbnb and host. I had a few minor issues, but he took care of them in a responsible and responsive fashion.\nOne caveat - the bed, while of good quality, is memory foam. A lot of people love that, but for some (like me) it's really bad for your back. If you're one of those people, sleep on the couch pull-out bed, or find a different location."", 'Omar’s was the perfect little place for our short trip to Austin - he was very hospitable and super helpful throughout our stay. We’ll be sure to book his apartment again for our next visit!', ""Omar's place is in a really good location for the University, just a 15 minute walk and has good amenities. The only thing I would say is that I was in Austin on a work trip and the ceiling is very thin. I was awoken most nights at around 4am by the neighbours above walking around and talking loudly. This, of course, is not Omar's fault but think it is something worth noting for people staying for work."", 'Extremely responsive and friendly host. Helped with immediate questions and was descriptive. Good local recommendations. Place was homey, leftover drinks in the fridge. Clear markings for everything. Close to the city by car.', 'This was the perfect base for my 2.5 week stay in Austin for research. It was walkable to UT and an easy walk to many bus routes, which was critical given that I did not have a car to get around during the Texas heatwave. On that note, the AC also works very well. The apartment was very well-equipped and comfortable. For longer stays, the only downside is the lack of a washer/dryer but there is a great laundromat (Laundry works) that is 20 minutes walk, and Omar has left a laundry card which you can take and top up to use. Thanks so much for the hospitality, Omar!', 'Great option for 3!!\nGood location near to downtown .', 'Great apartment and location close to campus, capitol, etc', ""Overall, I believe this place is a great value for its price. I spent two weeks here and found the location to be fantastic – situated in a vibrant and youthful neighborhood with a nearby university campus, yet still just a stone's throw from downtown.\nWhile there were a couple of minor drawbacks, such as the absence of laundry facilities and some noise from the upstairs neighbors. I suspect the last issue is more a reflection of the building's condition rather than anything specific to this unit. Specifically, footsteps from the floor above could be heard at times. Annoying when you are just about to go to bed ... Nonetheless, I would still recommend this accommodation as a solid choice for budget-conscious travelers seeking a convenient location."", 'Omar was a very responsive host and checked in with us throughout our stay. The location is good and close to a small market and coffee house if you need to run out for essentials while visiting. We noticed a musty smell when we first entered the apartment, but eventually we got used to it or it went away. Overall, it was a good price for the location and amenities.', 'Great place ti stay in Austin! Very central to bus lines and often you’ll find escooters around to get around for non-drivers. Airbnb is superb and very clean! Recommend to anyone', 'Great place for visiting UT. Fits the college vibe. Communication and check in fairly easy. Recommend!', 'Omar was a great host, and the place was just what I needed for my stay in Austin! Location is great, and the apt has every basic amenity that you might need for a short or long stay.

Needs some updating. The couches are old and stained. Some of the flooring is peeling up in spots. The bathroom curtain was pretty gross tbh.

The things that brought the rating down for me:\n1. Couches were incredibly uncomfortable, they were really flat and hard. I can’t imagine the bed in the couch would be comfortable just based on how uncomfortable the couch was, but I did not try it out.\n2. The beds were actually fairly comfortable, but creaked SO loudly every time they moved even an inch. As a light sleeper, I barely got any sleep as every time my partner rolled over it woke me up. The pillows also definitely need to be replaced, they’re all very old (or maybe just cheap?) down pillows that were too flat and lumpy to have any support.\n3. Lack of towels. There were exactly 4 bath towels for the 4 of us. There wasn’t a bath mat, so to keep us from getting water all over the bathroom floor every time we showered we had to use the only hand towel. There were also no dish towels in the kitchen.\n4.

I think the A/C unit is too small to cool down the place; only the air right in front of the ac unit itself is cool even with all fans blowing on full speed. The unit isn’t very well insulated, felt stuffy and humid and we unfortunately had to cancel our reservation early due to these circumstances.

A car rental is optimal for this location.\nAnd the bedroom gets a ton of natural light in the morning that you can’t block out, so if you’re a late riser, come with a sleeping mask.\nThere’s a lot of construction next door as well as behind the building right now, but if you’re out and about enjoying the city then you’re all good!', 'The spot was private and very cozy.

Will definitely be back.', 'We live in Austin & wanted to stay near downtown for a concert, but local hotels were very expensive for some reason. I checked Airbnb and found this reasonably priced option that is a short Uber from Moody Center. Yes it’s small but if you just need a place to sleep & unwind it’s a great option. The house is tidy & comfy. The outside patio had a fire pit but it was too warm to want to use it. My only suggestion to make the experience better would be to mow the grass because I think that would help with mosquitoes, which were abundant outside. When I reached out to Zoe twice with questions she answered within 2 minutes both times. If you need a comfy place to lay your head, I highly recommend this tiny house! Also, Hillside Farmacy restaurant is just a few blocks away, which I also recommend.', 'Perfect for a weekend getaway. Would stay here anytime I’m in Austin.', 'The place was clean and cute!

Location is quite good. There are 2 bus stops each a 1-3 minute walk away that take you straight into downtown. Place is just far away to get the peace and quiet at night while being walkable to just about everything you'd need. As the listing mentions, there is a microwave, hot plate and some other niceties, but it's a very small kitchen. With food trucks just a few minutes away... well, I didn't cook at all.\nWith a place this small, be prepared to live out of your suitcase!

Just enough for an overnight stay on our road trip', ""I was impressed. I liked the location very much. Walkable neighborhood and I felt safe. The bus stop was really close so i took advantage of it ( $2.50 for a 24 pass ) not a bad deal. I wish there was a bigger trash can... I ate takeout a few times and I walked to the dumpster down the street ( behind the quickie pickie ) to get rid of my trash. There was no place to put my clothes away. Under the ac/ heat unit there were hangers but a small dresser would have been great. Honestly those things were so minor I didn't give them much thought.

The vibe was peaceful without feeling...too quiet? I was in Austin for a kind of commuter retreat, and I couldn't have asked for a better space to hang my hat at the end of the day. The location is also great; I walked to the main drag of South Congress, which took about 30 minutes on foot (it was hot, though, lol!).

The toilet alone was messes up in multiple ways. The handle was lose, chain was too long, the float would get stuck and the chain would loop under the flange and prevent it from sealing. Everytime i had to flush i had to troubleshoot why the tank wasn't filling... beyond that the drain in the bath tub made a weird loud gurgling sound. i had to run the loud bathroom fan just apnit didn't wake me up.\nit badly needs to be dusted, ceiling fan and the walls had grey dust/cob webs all over.\nthey offered me a free night because of the Hassel at check in but i honestly won't be going back. there are so many better apartments in the area."", 'Unit is comfortable, quiet and in a great location.

I let Ted know he needed a deep clean, since the bathroom wasnt as clean as i would have liked and the walls needed to be wiped down. He was very receptive & had their cleaner come immediately. He was open to my feedback & appreciative of letting him know what was going on. The upstairs neighbor does have a heavy step so if you're a light sleeper be aware it could affect you.

To be fair, the description in the is inaccurate—it far exceeded my expectations and I am not sure that it is possible to convey so many extraordinary features in an airbnb listing:).\nThe ambiance, security, cleanliness, cool-factor, proximity to restaurants, amenities—-I could go on an on. The value for money is excellent —-actually pretty incredible considering nice hotels charge—-I would need my head examined if I were to consider staying any place else.\nNormally I am not swayed by the view—but it is incredible. I loved the bar downstairs which had coffee ready to go when i left.\nI ended up parking on the street outside the hotel,,paying until midnight with parking for free until 8am. In hindsight, I probably should have just used the valet parking.\nWhat a great experience and I will definitely stay here again.', ""My recent stay at this exceptional downtown Austin luxury condo was truly remarkable. Upon arrival, I was immediately impressed by the modern design and sophisticated furnishings. The floor-to-ceiling windows provided stunning skyline views, creating a bright and inviting atmosphere throughout the space.\nThe condo's prime location in the Rainey Street Historic District was a significant advantage, allowing us easy access to vibrant nightlife and a variety of outdoor activities. We thoroughly enjoyed exploring the nearby restaurants, bars, and parks, making our stay both enjoyable and convenient.\nThe amenities were outstanding, particularly the rooftop pool and the state-of-the-art fitness center, which enhanced our overall experience. The seamless check-in process and thoughtful features, such as luggage storage and accessible entry, added to our comfort.\nThis luxury condo is an ideal choice for anyone seeking a blend of comfort, convenience, and style in the heart of Austin."", 'We LOVED our stay in Austin at Alex’s condo. The view was fantastic, the condo is clean and the rooftop is the perfect place to relax at the end of the day. We enjoyed coffee downstairs in the morning and a glass of wine in the evening. Took an Uber to the convention center each day and rode scooters around too. Highly recommend!', 'great place, very clean, awesome location. I would go back for sure.', 'Odd check-in process, but worth the stay and price for historical Rainey street and nearby city trails. Street parking felt safe, no valet necessary.', 'Thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Austin! From host messages to personnel in the lobby and valet, everyone was so helpful and polite. Perfect for what we needed. Highly recommend', 'Great spot to stay at very cozy apartment with a great view.', 'Alex’s place was really clean, modern and spacious. We found it had everything we needed.\nWe had a very late check in that he accommodated (only $15 extra)\nRainey st and 6th street are very close. Lots of good food nearby.\nThe only thing that wasn’t ideal was renting an electric car and then realizing the nearby chargers were not finished being set up to charge.', 'We had a blast in the Rainey street district. The building was super modern and clean and only a 4 minute walk to the bars on Rainey. The apartment was super clean and had everything we needed for our stay. Parking was easy and there were always scooters right outside to make getting around to further parts of Austin very fun and accessible.', 'Great location and accommodations Alex was very responsive to our requests! Liked having the coffee shop in the lobby.', 'Great stay!! Super clean and the location and view is amazing!', 'Alex’s place worked out perfect for our stay in Austin. Location was the selling point. Walkable to Rainey St and downtown with ease. Right on the river so we were able to walk outside and start our morning runs along the river. Pool was under construction during our stay other than that, everything worked out great! Valet parking and street parking is available but expensive. We were able to park our rental vehicle only a few blocks away on the other side of the highway for free street parking each night. Would highly recommend!', 'The place is located in a perfect spot, close to everything. The building itself is stunning and makes you feel like you’re living in luxury. As far as the hosts go, they are super responsive and helpful. I even forgot a few things when leaving and they are helping me get them back. The views alone are worth coming back for but even outside of that the experience was a 10/10.', ""Great beautiful place. It's perfect... The location is awesome you could literally walk to bars and restaurants. Would definitely stay here again when we come to Austin"", 'Great location and beautiful views. Would stay here again in a heartbeat. Coffee shop downstairs and walkable to plenty of places including the River side path.', 'The listing was accurate as far as size & amenities. It was clean. A few things to consider before booking. There is construction EVERYWHERE near this building. Constant loud banging, beeping, & sounds of traffic. It made it difficult to sleep or relax. Had I known there was so much construction I would have reconsidered. The really only “walkable” area would be to rainey street… & I wouldn’t walk alone. Everything else required an Uber ride. Another note, there are 33 floors in this building. There were 3 elevators but only 1 worked during my stay. So it was a very long slow process every single day getting in and out due to this issue. Check in is stated as 4. I messaged the host (as instructed prior to check in)to let them know we would be arriving about an 1/1.5hr early to see if check in was available early. It was not-totally fine. But we then sat around and waited til about 4:15 before the host showed up to deliver our key cards it was frustrating. The stay was fine not great', 'Very nice view, looked exactly like the photos and Alex was so kind and hospitable! The staff in the building were also very nice. It was a great experience!', 'Amazing location! This was one of the best Airbnb I’ve stayed at', ""Stay was a great location to venues we were attending.

More amenities than listed in the kitchen and bathroom. Alex was very responsive and helpful. I would stay in this condo again!', 'I had a great stay in Austin. This unit was in a good part of the city, close to downtown but still away from the busy noise. I would recommend this place for anyone needing a nice crash pad while exploring the city.', 'The views were beautiful, there were so many things to do.', 'Very good location and view', 'We check in with Madison and she was amazing!\nThe space was as described and it was easy to check in. The pool was pretty with a nice view.\nCons:\nWhen we first entered the unit I noticed the floor in the bedroom was very wet, so I lifted the rug and there was a HUGE dead bug under it.\nThe dishwasher smells like mold, BAD.\nSomeone above us was washing their patio and ours got drenched with gross water. If I was sitting out there I would have been soaked.\nThere is construction all over rainey st, and its not the safest location so we didn’t really feel safe to walk around definitely be aware of that.\nPro:\nNice front desk people and host\nWashing machine was soooo nice to have!\nEasy to check in\nBed was comfy\nOverall:\nIf you don’t need a washing machine or a kitchen, I would stay in a hotel for the price.', 'Alex is gray and easy to deal with highly recommend staying at that place!', 'Great place with nice furnishings and very comfortable! I really enjoyed having the coffee shop downstairs so I could just run down and grab and go for a delicious latte or an afternoon snack. Great location with both Rainey street and the walking/biking trail just steps away from the condo building. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend for 1-2 people.', ""You can't go wrong with this place. You're right outside the door of Rainier Street. Austin's main dive of unique bars and restaurants. You're also only a couple miles from the sixth string entertainment district. If you've never been the Austin before this is a great place to just start to know the location. This is basically a Top G Andrew Tate freaking suite And it's very cool and worth it If you're visiting Austin. or maybe transitioning like I am looking for apartments. I would definitely recommend doing this again. The city views on the balcony are almost unmatched. they give you two cards so don't lose them. That's my best advice"", 'Wonderful place to stay when visiting Austin. Great location. Place was very clean and decorated so well. Amazing views of the city.', 'We loved our stay at Alex’s condo! Amazing property. Perfect for river walk, and we had a blast on Rainey for food, drinks, and live music. We did take out on the rooftop on night for a million dollar view. Alex is incredibly responsive with communication. We would definitely stay again for our visit to Austin! PS: we Ubered everywhere we didn’t walked and worked out great! Skip the rental car!!', 'Love the place, will be coming back', 'The entire condo smelled like mildew. The bedding was moist still and the bathroom was still extremely wet from the previous tenant. Crumbs and food on the chairs and under the table. The balcony view is of I-35 & a building under construction. The pictures made it seem like the unit was facing west towards town lake, not north. Not a huge deal, just misleading. We booked specifically for the pool, but the pool was completely full at 10am on a Thursday, so there was nowhere to sit. We went back two other times this weekend and still couldn’t find anywhere to sit. Valet isn’t $40 per night, they charge you an additional $10 in taxes and fees so it’s actually $50 per night. Which is actually ridiculous. Paying $150 total for parking on top of the room charge was insane. There was nowhere to park on the street. Finally, on checkout day it took over 30 minutes just to get an elevator. Everyone checks out at 10am so getting out right at 10 is pretty impossible. I just felt really mislead.', 'Beautiful place. Convenient location.', 'Worked well for our purposes', 'Great place with nice view.', 'Great location in Downtown Austin. Rooftop pool relaxing.

Can’t wait to come back in the future!', 'Great location, Great view. Balcony was a bit dusty but didn’t bother us much. This place has a great kitchen stocked with any cookware, silverware and utensils you may need. There was a washing machine with tide pods available and dryer worked well. Bed is firm yet comfortable and the A/c works great. I would 100% book this room again. Alex was nice enough to let us have a late check out at (11:30am). My only real complaint is that there is no Full body mirror. The only mirror is in the bathroom which made getting ready a little inconvenient while my GF was doing her make up. It would’ve been nice to get ready while she did that and see my entire outfit. That being said its a great room at a very reasonable price. Enjoyed my stay a lot.', 'Perfect location! We will stay here again!', 'Can’t beat the location! Condo is very nice and at a really good rate. Would absolutely stay here again.', 'Quick walk to Rainey Street bars. Pool was beautiful.

Also, the tiny house is located behind a private residence. I arrived at night, so I felt a little intimidated walking toward the back of the property while the homeowners were home. But, the keypad check-in was *seamless!* I LOVE a keypad check-in. Thanks to the host for that. ☺️\nFinally, my favorite bonus of this stay was the Koko’s Guide to Austin book (from ATX food blogger @atasteofkoko) in the welcome basket.

To start with the positives, the place was neat, clean, and easy to find. Its location is excellent, close to all the main activity centers in Austin.\nHowever, I had significant concerns regarding safety. The locks on the doors were weak, and there were no additional security measures or amenities to make us feel secure inside the property.\nOur check-in experience was particularly frustrating. Despite arriving at the property on time, we were unable to check in for 20 minutes because the host didn't provide clear instructions for the passcode to the main entrance. Even after multiple calls and messages, the host did not respond promptly, causing a delay and disrupting our plans for the day.\nRegarding amenities, they were very basic. If you're planning a stay with family or a group, I wouldn't recommend this place, as it lacks games or activities typically found in other Airbnbs.\nOverall this property needs work"", 'excellent host, great convenient location. cooked during our stay and had all the tools we needed. place was very clean! had a great stay', 'This stay was extremely enjoyable, the hosts were friendly, and kind, and the place was quiet, and comfortable.

It shows its age (the exterior of the complex is baby blue, for instance) but it's well-maintained and the a/c & the entertainment center worked easily. The hot water was immediate! Because it's on a big street near a hospital, I wondered whether the sounds of sirens would be a problem at night, but I never heard them. The bedroom window faced a quiet and attractive interior courtyard.\nWe had very few problems, and they were addressed immediately.

We found the house clean on our arrival, there were enough linens and towels, the kitchen was well equipped, and the host responded promptly to all the messages we sent him.\nThe sofa bed, however, was somewhat uncomfortable as the mattress was very thin and the spring springs felt.\nThe air conditioning was also uncomfortable as it was very noisy and when it was in operation you could barely sleep.\nThe outdoor units of the own air conditioners and neighbors were also very noisy.\nLastly, the internet connection was very slow, it was constantly interrupted or just there were moments of the day that didn't work.\nThe location of the place was great, being relatively close to downtown Austin."", 'There were no issues, everything as shown is 100% accurate.

It was a beautiful design, and uniquely decorated with so many considerate touches for travelers. The porch feels like a treehouse and so lovely and relaxing to sit outside and listen to all the birds//nature. It's a quiet neighborhood, but located in a central spot to get to several destinations in a short amount of time. Highly recommend renting a car as everything in Austin is rather spread out. Ally had wonderful local recommendations to offer. We really enjoyed Terry Black's BBQ (which was after we saw the epic long line with chairs at Franklin's before they even opened), and DeNada was a delicious for tacos and margaritas. Highly recommend a morning swim at Barton Springs, which was a highlight. Overall, this was a private and relaxing little spot with great design//ambiance.

Spotlessly clean, and the hosts always happy to help with any request. Geared more to eating out, or, what I did, getting a ready meal at Whole Foods which is less than 15 minutes away, and on the route home, to pop into the microwave and enjoy on the quiet porch. The bed is also very comfortable. The place looks exactly as in the photos.

The place comes with a dining area but not a full kitchen which was fine with me because I wanted to order/dine out at local restaurants as much as possible during my visit. The place does come with a small fridge, microwave, coffee maker and tea kettle.

Beautiful building in a great location. Easy to find and very walkable to restaurants. There is a walking path along the river right next to the building. The views are magnificent. The staff is very friendly and quick to respond to requests. They make every effort to make you feel comfortable and well taken care of.', 'Check in was a breeze. Close to Rainey street and close enough walk to 6th street. Views from the 30th floor. There’s two bedrooms and a pull out couch. Overall great place to stay.', 'For a group of girls this was perfect and walkable to everything we wanted to do- the pool and rooftop was an awesome plus!', 'This place is very beautiful. Views are lovely. Beds are good. A few things that weren’t worth the cost. $40 daily valet. Zero flexibility on check in and check out. 10:00 am for check out is really early and 4:00 for check out is pretty late. Also, the listing reflects that the kitchen is equipped for basic meal prep. All we wanted to do was put something in the oven. There was not a single over safe dish/pan in the place. There is also tons of construction all around the place which makes getting in/out challenging and some noise. It’s the city though. All in all, a very nice place.', 'Clean space, close to Rainey street with lots to do, fun scooters to ride (lime or bird) out front, didn’t like the coffee shop downstairs but rest was nice', ""Excellent property with a view of downtown and the river. Outstanding amenities - bar, coffee shop, pool, etc. Some noise filtered in from nearby construction in the mornings, but it wasn't overwhelming. Easily walkable to everything on Rainey Street. The elevators took a while - with no dedicated service elevator (cleaning crew shared the 4 resident elevators) and most people checking in/out around the same time. This is a residential condo building but it seems to be 90% short stay groups of guests."", 'We really enjoyed the great location, close to all the Austin nightlife and restaurants.\nGreat view and ez ck in with a really nice pool. We had a corner unit and had beautiful views of all the boats, kayaker and stand up paddle boarders. Well worth the price considering the cost of local hotels. Would definitely stay there again.', 'Perfect place to stay for a girls weekend! The views were incredible and we had everything we needed as far as amenities. Check in was easy and the front desk staff were very friendly. We were allowed early check in which was great. At check out, we were able to store our luggage on site until our flight out later that evening. 5 minute walk to Rainey St., food trucks, etc. Quick Uber drive to 6th St./downtown. Around the corner was a nice market/store for any last minute items needed. Very clean place to stay and highly recommend!', 'Great location, comfortable condo with modern amenities. The view from the 30th floor is Amazing.', 'Great place friendly staff great view', 'Beautiful views, super clean! The bathrooms were great. Loved it.', 'Good place with a great view and good location with proximity to Rainey street. Nice amenities and coffee shop.', ""Loved every moment of Austin and this unit. It's an easy walk to Rainey Street, the walking path along the river, Congress Street, etc. It's a very clean, modern space with great amenities in the building and rooftop. And that view... insane!

A perfect spot for a girls weekend away... thank you for opening your space to us! Highly, highly recommend!"", 'The view from the balcony were phenomenal!

The space was clean and comfortable, great master bed, great shower. Would highly recommend!', 'This rental space was amazing! I would definitely recommend.', '......', 'This is a great location and view of Ladybird Lake. There is a nice pool and easy access to entertainment.

But will definitely stay here again. Beautiful view.', 'I loved staying here! The people and atmosphere was great as soon as I waked in.', 'Great, clean, and well located. Many restaurants within walkable distance. The view is OUTSTANDING!\nThe ONLY downside experienced was the lack of pool availability for the children - due to the obviously inebriated, young-adult crowd. TO BE FAIR it could have just been these two days, but I felt I should mention.\nOverall, it was very good experience, and would consider booking again.', 'great stay', 'Very happy with the property and the condo in general, with one exception. The bedding quality (especially the pillows) was terrible. Cheap and uncomfortable. Good quality bedding would have made this place five stars.', 'Great place on the 30th floor with a amazing view!', 'This is an amazing location! The view is outstanding. It is walkable to many restaurants, bars, the river and the trail. It is a very safe location. The unit was very clean and is just as photos show. Communication with Vacasa was great, they were very responsive and provided easy and good information about check in, check out and everything in between. I would highly recommend staying here and will hopefully return.', 'This place was just what the doctor ordered. Beautiful views of the Austin skyline and was very close to a lot of the Dowtown action, especially RAINEY Street( 2 blocks away). We booked here last minute and would not hesitate to stay here again if the opportunity to come back to Austin presents itself in the future.']",['7 guests · Studio · 4 beds · 2 baths'],https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/782617892697957983?adults=1&children=0&enable_m3_private_room=true&infants=0&pets=0&search_mode=regular_search&check_in=2024-12-01&check_out=2024-12-06&source_impression_id=p3_1729616507_P3cFbAC5A-42IZMd&previous_page_section_name=1000&federated_search_id=6ca9e3e3-c36e-4367-8d48-6fc207b743b6

I was concerned about the vagrants roaming the area while having issues with the lock. I reached out to Air BnB to cancel my reservation due to a variety of safety reasons. The most concerning being the lock.

Upon arrival it was not clean so we had to find a last minute replacement. We found this place and our reservation was accepted within minutes. Samuel was super helpful and responsive.

I do want to note that the loft bed is higher than it look in the pictures, so if you’re scared of heights please be aware of that.

I had complete privacy and I could come in and go anytime since the tiny house is separate from the main house. The fact that it also had a couch and a TV differentiated it from the rest of the tiny homes I have stayed in. The place was spacious and had good lighting so I never felt congested.

The only drawback is that the roof for the bed is small so it's easy to hit your head if you are not careful."", 'Honestly this was my first time at an airbnb, and it was AMAZING!!! it was so peaceful and homey. i am very picky when it comes to cleanliness and the expectations where TOP TIER! i will definitely stay again, i did not want to leave from how comfortable i felt and the lighting in the home was perfect as well. i just loved it all!

Thanks for having us!', 'Great Airbnb!', 'TL;dr - Just right for a quick couple nights\nPopped into Austin for a couple nights and this was a great place to stay! The AirBnb was located close to the highway, so it was easy to get around the city. The interior looked exactly like the photos. It was clean & cute and just what I needed.\nI agree with the other reviewers that if you are afraid of heights, this may not be the spot for you. The bed *is* high. Also, the tiny house is located behind a private residence. I arrived at night, so I felt a little intimidated walking toward the back of the property while the homeowners were home. But, the keypad check-in was *seamless!* I LOVE a keypad check-in. Thanks to the host for that. ☺️\nFinally, my favorite bonus of this stay was the Koko’s Guide to Austin book (from ATX food blogger @atasteofkoko) in the welcome basket.

Thanks!', 'I loved this place. It feels private, despite being a duplex. Walking distance to many east Austin spots and the river. The bed is wickedly comfortable. Lovely shower. Cozy front porch. Overall very homey spot and was pleased with my stay. I would come back!', 'Great location and homey feel. Would recommend!', 'This was a really amazing stay.

Walkable to river, restaurants, and shops. Inside decor was inspirational and well curated. Would absolutely come back!', 'I had to book last minute during a work trip and I feel so lucky Meshelle’s place was available! I felt right at home with the cozy decor and lively vibe.

What a location and what a place!!!', 'Great spot. House was comfortable, bed was nice. Walkable to tons of things. Would definitely stay again.', 'Close to downtown with plenty to do around the corner.', 'We loved this Airbnb. This was our first time visiting Austin, and we are so glad that we stayed at this home. The only complaint that we had - We were told that there was a fenced in backyard, however there was not. Upon arrival, we let our dogs out of the back door and they ran away. Thankfully we got them home safely rather quickly. II am still giving this home 5 stars because although this was a scary incident, the host made it up to us, offered to block off the backyard and even gave us an extra night for free. We fell in love with this location and it has actually made us decide to take the leap and move to Austin. I dont think there is a better area to stay other than East Austin. We couldnt have asked for a better place to call our home away from home.', 'We stayed at Mechelle’s Airbnb for 2 months! A first for us, but we like the location in east Austin. The house is super cool and spent some time on the big front porch (before the heat hit!) eating breakfast. The bed was comfy and the bathroom is a nice size and has a big walk in shower. I love the wallpaper in the bathroom-big and bright flowers. Mechelle has great taste and always replied quickly if we had a question. Easy walk to my fav coffee shop, Flat Track and we had dinner once a week at Bufalina-great pizza!\nI recommend the bungalow for its groovy style and it’s location.', 'There are strengths and weaknesses to this spot. The house was very clean and we were able to instantly book at the last minute. They were also generous with a late checkout, which was very helpful.\nAs others have mentioned, the house is comfortable and has cool decorations, but it’s missing a bit of polish. I really like eclectic decorating, but I also think shelves don’t look great with unattached brackets sticking out and floors shouldn’t have gaps in them.\nWe did sometimes find the communication to be lacking. The home is managed by several people and they didn’t seem to talk to each other. For example, the previous guest accidentally took the parking pass, but no one communicated that to us or told us that she’d show up on the porch looking for something she’d left behind (she had told the owners this). When we did get the pass, it was expired. We were given a late checkout, but someone walked into the house while we were still there and then apologized and left.', 'We had a wonderful stay! The aesthetic was so cute, very clean, and they had absolutely everything you could need, exactly where you’d need it. The bed was very comfortable and the shower was so luxurious. I can’t recommend enough!', ""We booked Meshelle's place at the last minute to escape a hotel horrorshow we found ourselves in- and what a silver lining it was! Incredible location, beautiful space with a cozy home-like vibe, clean, safe, well-stocked. Couldn't have asked for a better stay during our time in Austin!"", 'Great stay, Mechelle was always quick to respond, and the property was great!', 'Great area. Perfect place.', 'Cute place to stay!\nVery spacious and comfortable for a trip. ☺️', 'Absolutely wonderful place!', 'Had a great time! Host were very responsive and the unit was very clean and accommodating.\nIt’s in the HEART of the city on the east side so you can’t go wrong! Drinks lounge practicality in your back yard!?!?

We enjoyed our stay and would recommend to others!', 'Comfortable and thoughtfully decorated! Loved all the live plants!', 'Perfect place! Price, location, walkable!', 'Had a great time! We loved the large shower, though we spent most our time out on the town. Good location to some good resturants. Well decorated.', 'Our stay at the property was wonderful. We highly recommend this stay for those looking for the proximity of downtown Austin, without the noise and bustle of the city of itself. Meshelle was extremely helpful and responsive throughout our stay. 10/10.', 'Safe, clean, close to everything', 'absolutely wonderful stay', 'Perfect stay for my needs! I was in town for a work event and the location was walkable to restaurants and bars on the East side and a short drive away from Downtown Austin. Location was easy to find and felt like a home away from home. Thank you for a wonderful stay!', 'Great location with lots to do in the area.', 'Love!!! Amazing location', 'Loved the bnb an location! Host was gracious and thoughtful. 10/10 would book again.', ""Talk about a great place in the perfect location! We were excited for a quick getaway in Austin but didn't realize that our BnB was going to be one of the best highlights. A nice upscale dinner just 3 minutes away, we went to a very eclectic bar just a few streets down, then after a short walk more we wandered in and out of food truck parks and tents with all sorts of nick nacks... leaving is almost not necessary, although enjoyable. The B&B has everything you could need, including a full kitchen, a very bright and comfortable living space, and one of the most beautiful walk-in showers.\nI have saved this listing to stay again!"", 'Nice', 'Great place to stay!

The space was very clean and had all of the necessities for a few days stay. Location is great to explore the city. Checking in and out was easy. Overall we had a great stay.', 'My boyfriend and I stayed in this Airbnb for a week while I took care of some personal business, and it worked great for a longer stay. We both WFH and thought the space was great for that. We also loved staying in this area of Austin because it’s more residential but also right next to downtown. We loved eating our lunch on the patio each day. Amenities were awesome! I’d say the Airbnb could use a couple of extra bath towels but besides that, the place really was perfect. The host is super responsive!', 'Great place to stay. Very cute and close to a lot of things! We really enjoyed our stay here', 'Great location. Fun space.', 'Such a beautiful place! If you love plants and lots of sun light this is the place to stay. I will definitely be back :)', 'Everything you need to be comfortable and right at home. Space was very clean and welcoming. Very comfortable king bed! The fixtures in the bathroom were really loose so I didn’t use them for towels because the tp holder was already missing.. .previous review mentioned the shelving… seems like it’s unfinished and still in the works leaving it feel unpolished, but functional. More hangers would be helpful for those with longer stays. Small details.. but I enjoyed my stay on the east side for certain! Would stay again. Plus the little\nBook on Austin local favorites was awesome… Spot on suggestions …used Great Nail from the book and had best mani pedi for years!!', 'The place was nice, small things that felt out of place but overall it was just enough just for a night', ""I really love this spot. I'm a light sleeper and was happily surprised to find that it's nice and quiet, even though it's located super close to lots of restaurants and cocktail spots. It's also a short walk to Ladybird Lake which was such a lovely way to start the morning. The space is well-decorated and full of thoughtful add-ons. Only issue was the password listed on the card in the unit was incorrect and internet name in the check-in didn't quite match which I resolved by tethering my phone for video meetings, but I got creative and figured it out eventually and the host let me know they'll get that fixed for future guests. Highly recommend this spot!"", 'Had a lovely stay. Very comfortable king size bed, slept great.

Lots of options for food and drink. On Check in one thing not listed was to punch in the code then hit the main button for the door to open but my son figured it out. Also, a Thing came up with the washer but it worked out. I would stay again. It is very fresh and new. Amenities were great!', 'I had a great stay at Meshelle’s place. It was easy to find and in a great location. Everything was as described and the bed was comfortable. Thank you!', ""Meshelle's,\n\nWas a wonderful host, and we had great accommodations.\nWe love staying on the East side due to we are over 40 and Downtown isn't always ideal. Cesar Chavez is always our go-to when we stay in Austin.\nYou are close to 4 really awesome bars, all within walking distance. There is La Barbacue, which is always a must. Cigar lovers, there is a Cigar place close as well as the Cigar Vault!\nUber is always a great way to get around, or you can always walk...\nwe will definitely stay again. Thank you!"", 'Welcoming space for travelers. Thank you very much!', 'Nice place and good location', 'Meshelle’s place was a great little gem to stay in for a girls weekend. It was clean, comfy, and perfectly located! I do wish there were more towels provided (unless we just missed them somewhere lol) but it wasn’t an issue. The kitchen is stocked well and the bed and couches were comfy for sleeping and hanging out. They even accommodated an early check in. Totally recommend their place!', 'Very nice area with lots to do in walking distance. The house was also a cozy place to stay at.', 'Good place', 'Wonderful stay and communicative host.

The place was very clean and the home came equipped with anything you might need. Definitely would recommend', 'We enjoyed our stay! The place was comfortable and felt welcoming. We love Austin and it was located in an area that was pretty close to everything.', 'Great location and uniquely designed! Loved the design of the house. We ended up walking to dinner and getting drinks at some of the bars nearby. There is even a bar right next door, but, surprisingly, no noise disturbed us as we went to sleep!', 'Good support from hosts during an insanely freezing cold week in Austin. Will look for them again next visit.', 'What a cute spot in East Austin! So much personality. Booked this place for a last minute girls weekend and it did not disappoint! Perfect little gem 💎', 'Great stay! Super cute!!', ""This airbnb is in a great location. There are many taco stands, coffee, bars, and both veggie and meat restaurants within a block. You are also less than a half mile walk to the trails along Lady Bird lake. Getting to downtown and the interstate are short drives. The place itself is fairly large. My girlfriend and I both worked remotely for a whole week and it was one of the best remote work spots we've tried. The place is right next to a loud bar, but we never had any issues--it was surprisingly quiet inside. The porch area is in front of the house. I enjoyed it and used it quite a bit, but its not particularly quiet or private. The interior of the house is well appointed and eclectically decorated. There are some less than polished things such as broken cabinet hardware and exposed unfinished shelves and table within the bedroom. This stuff did not bother us but if you're picky about such things you might take that into account. Overall I would stay here again and would recommend."", 'We had such a lovely time staying here. The house was very well designed, clean and well stocked. Host was extremely responsive and went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable. I would definitely recommend this place. Great location and walking distance to some really cool spots. Would definitely stay here again.', 'Amazing Stay', ""I was so impressed with my stay at this lovely place.

We absolutely loved the layout and style. Such comfy quiet sleeps even being close to some local bars and restaurants. The weather was perfect for some happy hours on the porch, and the location is great for walking places … which we loved.

We both work from home and there was plenty of workspace and the internet was great.', 'Perfect little oasis to enjoy while still staying on the local side. This spacious 1 bedroom open concept home was perfect just for me or if I wanted to bring friends along. There was a few issues with pests ( I would have loved access to bug spray or a broom to help out with pests.)\nHowever, I absolutely loved the style throughout the home! It created a warm, relaxing earthy feel to the home. My favorite room was the bathroom & kitchen. Absolutely stunning, & the shower was everything I could have asked for & more!! The fresh plants added to the decorum & overall positive energy radiating from this place.\nIt was relaxing & I enjoyed my time in Austin & will book again with Meshelle & team :D', 'This was our second time staying here, it’s the perfect location! Love this spot!', 'Great property and location!!', 'The Bungalow was everything we wanted and more.

Already looking forward to booking again next time we’re in Austin :)', 'We enjoyed our stay here at Meshelle’s bungalow. It is in the perfect area, 5 minutes from downtown and close to everything. We did get a ticket for parking in front of the residency since there is no actual parking but Meshelle and her team resolved the issue. We would love to stay here again in the future.', 'Great location, very cute decor, loved the place.', 'Amazing stay and host', ""Meshelle's listing was fantastic. She was extremely easy to communicate with and responded quickly to my questions. Her house is well kept, I personally LOVE the collection of propagated plants and art throughout the home.

They were always very responsive and helpful if I had any questions.Only comment I have is that if you run cold the place gets realllly cold. I visited when it was very hot and humid outside so understandable. You can ask for blankets or just leave your personal room window open which is what I did.', 'Ideal for those who want to stay in a nice and clean place in Austin.

Totally walkable. No need for uber or lift from the airport. You can just take the bus.\nThe room is nice, large, private. The bedsheet, pillowcase, and towels were clean. Plenty of room from suitcase, backpacks. Has clothes hanger for you to use. Kitchen and living room are large and clean.\nVery responsive hosts.\nCons\nThe bathroom kind of smells a bit. Not sure of what and didn’t really go away with air fresheners. You can hear raccoons/rats/idk in the walls and ceiling in the living room early in the morning, which is not that troublesome for me. The hosts were really quick with their responses, though, and were willing to address the issue. However, it didn’t bother me that much that I would need them to come in.', 'everything was great', 'We had a mix up with the amount of guests booked for our reservation and they were very flexible with accommodating us so that we didn’t have to find another place to stay.

The house was spacious, very clean, organized, the other guests very friendly and the room clean and nicely done up. We had a great time walking through the nearby Boggy Creek Greenbelt area and having tacos at Veracruz All Natural. Two things we'd fault are that the AC was quite loud during the night (and non-controllable), and the area didn't seem very safe in particular at night. The house across the street was shady, there was trash strewn all across the street (coming from the house) and combative neighbours from the house on the corner defined the immediate area outside during our four-day stay.

Would stay here again', ""I enjoyed staying at Adam's place. It feels very private. The rear guest house is a prefabricated one but it is well designed. The kitchen sink is functional but small. The refrigerator is a small one like you would find in a hotel room. The bed is quite comfortable.\nThe bathroom was large with lots of counter space, good lighting, a good toilet and a very good shower. The water pressure was not great but I understand that is a problem in that neighborhood.\nI like to use my computer and I pad at a table or desk and was surprised there were not more plugs around the desk, while there were a lot in the bathroom.\nOn the whole, I enjoyed staying at this Airbnb."", ""This place is a gem. Adam is also a really chill and cool guy so that's the cherry on top. Studio is very demure, very mindful - it's kind of artsy and has a touch of old Austin. Homey, bright, warm, and earthy. I stayed alone; super clean upon arrival and had everything that I needed. AC was also a plus on days where it got hot, and you don't need to crank it down super low for it to cool the place. There are multiple points of 'security' I found that also helped me feel super safe coming in and out, especially during the night.\nAdam was super communicative and responded quickly to any concern or question I had. You can tell that he really takes care of this place and makes sure it's always in peak condition. Even on days where work was being done around the studio, he let me know. This studio is an extension of him, and it reflects in the overall aura and feel. If you're looking for a laidback, calm, and easygoing place to stay in Austin, this is it."", 'We had a great time staying in this cozy back house!

There were thoughtful touches, including coffee and snacks. Alex was very responsive and checked in to make sure everything was ok.\nJust a note that the main house is also rented out, including a shared yard (there was a small dog who was not thrilled with our arrival). The guests seemed unaware that the studio was being rented, but were mostly able to avoid each other in the shared yard.', 'Was an amazing stay, felt safe and secure.

Would definitely recommend this cute little place!', ""I visited for work however I know the area pretty well having lived nearby and can attest that this location is fantastic for easy access to both downtown, the East side and the hike & bike trails along the water. It's also close to the highway if you need to go on longer excursions. The space itself is very private, well appointed and comfortable overall. I really enjoyed being able to relax on the patio to reset after a hard day at work, before hitting the town. I also appreciated amenities such as the laundry machine (with supplied fragrance-free detergent!), coffeemaker (with supplied ground coffee!) and the rest.

Great location and cute spot!', 'Alex’s place was nice, but the two biggest issues we had were: one, we found cockroaches. We reached out and they apologized and said they’d make sure pest control comes out after our stay, BUT it’s really alarming staying somewhere with cockroaches. Also, the bed wasn’t very comfortable, that’s a very personal preference thing so may be great for others. But those 2 points are mainly what hurt my review. Also there’s no great place to sit, just a small dining table without great seats, but that is accurate to the posting. They did provide snacks, coffee, and tea which was a nice touch.\nWe also stayed during one of the hottest periods in TX so although it only took like 15-20 min to walk places, we couldn’t because the heat was too much(nothing wrong with the place in this instance, just the location not being great)\nAll in all, the place was fine for the 2 of us, but we did have a couple of not great experiences (mainly the cockroaches) that would prob. not have us stay here again.', 'Clean .

Perfect for wqlk to convention center', 'Great place to stay! Has everything you need and can’t beat the location. Really enjoyed my time there!', 'The airbnb matches the pictures exactly. The only gripe I have is that parking can be tricky as the street the airbnb is on gets very busy.

Very close to many interesting locations in Austin tx and very peaceful at night. The bed is really comfortable and the free parking is great. We had everything we needed for the most part although there are a few things that I found to be an annoyance and maybe even a safety concern. Firstly, there’s no microwave. That was incredibly annoying as most cheaper hotels tend to include at least a small microwave. Second, the ac unit used in the apartment was incredibly weak. It would take hours for the apartment to get anywhere near being cold. It was quite warm throughout my stay and sleeping was a bit uncomfortable due to that. The little ac unit just couldn’t get the job done as much as it tried. Third, the gas stove was placed right next to the gas water heater. That’s definitely a safety hazard as no flammable object or anything of the sort should be placed next to a gas water heater let alone a whole stove. Using the stove just wasn’t an option due to the safety concerns and not having a microwave made staying there a tad bit annoying. Lastly, there was little to no privacy which was a huge disappointment. The large windows in the front had no curtains so anyone walking by could look right in. I don’t think adding curtains would be too much trouble because they are definitely needed as privacy is very important. Other than that, as mentioned above the location was great and pretty peaceful.

It is just off of South Congress, and there was also an option to easily get to the highway It's also not a far drive to downtown. There is plenty of street parking, and there was always a spot in the driveway. I didn't meet Leann during my weekend stay, but she was responsive to my messages.\nThe space is as described and seen in the photos. There was a nice, big bathroom. There wasn't an actual kitchen, but there was a nice big refrigerator/freezer to put leftovers in. And overall, it was a very comfortable stay. There was central a/c and a separate a/c window unit. My only issue was that the central a/c was a bit cold for me. (I had only packed shorts and very light, summer clothing.) Since it was central a/c, I didn't bother asking to turn up the temperature a little... perhaps I should have. Regardless, I recommend the place, especially if you enjoy having your own privacy."", 'Place is nice enough - bit on the cozy side.

The setup covers all the real necessities, but there is not a lot of storage furniture to unpack into.\nThere is a small somewhat private garden outside, with a patio table and a couple of chairs - this was much appreciated on a sunny day.\nThe internet connection is great.

Reccomend!', ""This is a great spot if you don't mind being attached to the owners. everything advertised was correct, the place was very clean and easy to access. For some reason I thought the location was detached from the owners but it is not. You can hear people (they were not loud but just made me feel uneasy), and you can smell they dinner so you are literally in the other room. If this doesn't bother you than you will be fine. They are close to every thing between 15-20 minutes depending where you are going. If you are a lover of hot water make sure you put on the fan to suck out the steam because the alarm will go off when you close the bathroom door. It's enough space for two people, no stove to cook on, just a microwave and toaster... they do have snacks/Souvenirs for purchase, as far as water I am not too sure if it was faucet water in the container (prefer bottle water). I personally won't be back just because of preferences but if you are in town for a quick stay and don't require much amenities go for it!!!! It's priced right just wish there was bottled water available and most air BNB give you a welcome package like a bottle of wine and some snacks.""]",['2 guests · 1 bedroom · 2 beds · 1 bath'],https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/31005465?adults=1&children=0&enable_m3_private_room=true&infants=0&pets=0&search_mode=regular_search&check_in=2024-11-10&check_out=2024-11-15&source_impression_id=p3_1729616477_P3bJa9m2QuZHC-lA&previous_page_section_name=1000&federated_search_id=bb8e6898-b5ff-4b7a-ac11-c9e061d89d15

If you have a rolling luggage, expect a little difficulty when wheeling it through their backyard since it’s mainly gravel ground. Additionally, the spiral staircase is NARROW. Even for a smaller person like me, it was somewhat hard to climb up/down the stairs, especially with our luggages. Lastly, the loft area is small space & only suitable for a child.\nDuring the trip, Patrice gave us a heads up of thunderstorms in the area. Truly showed how caring she is. Luckily, we were able to catch Patrice on our way out, and she was the absolute sweetest.\nTreehouse bungalow is a 10/10. We couldn’t have asked for more on our first trip to Austin 🤠', ""The treehouse was a perfect jumping-off point for our Austin weekend adventures! It's small but never feels cramped.

I would come back to Austin just to stay here again!

We opted for a suburban feel vs. downtown and were very satisfied with our choice; the neighborhood is very quiet and there are great and interesting dining and shopping options nearby. The room itself worked well with a large, comfortable bed for me and a cute upstairs loft for my daughter. We both slept very well. Although there is no dishwasher or kitchen sink the hosts provide a bin for dirty plates, etc. and they take care of them as needed. The shower (also a tub) and provided products made us feel new again each day! This was our first visit to Austin and we hope to be back soon - we had a very nice time exploring the UT campus and enjoying the “weird” (this is a good thing!) dining options.', ""We loved staying at Patrice & Daniel's!

Great cocktails there, too!!', 'the bnb was nice.the pool view is beautiful bed was clean, and the kitchen was great as well as the bathroom. A tad smaller that I imagined but was only there to sleep. one thing I did not like was being charged $125+ as a cleaning charge and still expected to clean and take the trash out and pull the linen and leave the towels somewhere, etc. seems a little off.', 'Great location for exploring the city- walkable to lots of the areas I wanted to walk to ( walk to Barton Springs, lovely 1 hour walk along the river with great swimming at the springs ) - flat is exactly as the photos. Had great intentions of using the gym but the bed was so comfortable lie ins were on the cards. I would stay again if in Austin', 'This place is petty good and it’s a nice apartment they have gym and top roof pool, pool was busy most of the time and by long they have bar, prices are okay, around the apartment there are bars restaurants and grocery store. All of them 5-10m walk distance. As a parking they have very safe parking lot by valet, but if you use valet you have limited access to you car you have to keep ask them to bring you car even if you just need something small, also there is a street parking and parking lot in front of the apartment that you can park so that’s something you have to keep in mind if you are using your car a lot. Beside that everything else where smooth checking and check out where so easy access to pool and gym also very easy too.

Manager/concierge were awesome, and helped me coordinate a delivery of flowers to the room before our arrival. Unfortunately, there were two issues: one of the curtains in the bedroom was broken and could not roll open, and there was a hole in the bathtub half way up. The manager did try to get a handyman to come fix these during our stay, but we were not able to get schedules to line up. The shower still worked, and we were able to see the sun rise from the deck. I trust that these have been fixed since our stay, but we are disappointed that these issues affected us. Overall, I was happy with the level of communication from the manager, and the building is in a great location.\nJust one other thing to keep an eye on: when we stayed, the rooftop pool heater was not working or was perhaps turned off (in February). May be good to verify if you plan to use the pool.', 'Great host and very professional, beautiful area and prime location. Will be back for sure !', 'Our stay was great.

The only complain is the elevators take forever to come - you can be waiting up to 5 minutes for the elevator to come.', 'Great place to stay! Great view and location with lots of amenities for the price point. Walkable to Rainey street and Lady Bird Lake is right around the corner. When we were there, this place and the surrounding streets were well lit and lively, so we felt safe walking late at night. Only critique is the WIFI issues with the TV, had to troubleshoot and try various things to get it to work, but host was responsive in all this. Valet is quick and convenient!

There was plenty of staff help on site for luggage, questions, etc., the place was almost even better than the photos describe (because the building lobby has a cute cafe/bar, and the place is stunning), and the location was easy walking distance from fun food, drinks, and really helpful market. We stayed late august and in a 5 minute walking radius we had dinner, drinks, and picked up some tums 😅 All that’s to say, it’s elegant and homey and central to you can ask for.', 'Overall, my husband & I had an enjoyable stay, but wouldn’t stay again. We think we could have a very similar experience for a cheaper price.\nPROS: Listing was accurate, clean, & accommodating. Host was very responsive (maybe a little too much with all the texts I received prior to my arrival). Location was nice.\nCONS: Biggest con was the price - the nightly cost + $40 valet parking + $120 cleaning fee + non refundable damage waiver on top of all Airbnb’s fees. For the price we’re paying, I shouldn’t have to strip the bed & run the dishwasher for you. I’m on vacation. Additionally, I didn’t care for the third party contract you’re required to sign with SuperHog or whatever prior to showing up. You basically have to do a full walk through of the space to document any prior damage so as to remove liability from yourself… not the first thing I’d like to do on my vacation. Lastly, we encountered some WiFi issues pretty consistently (not the fault of the owner) but something to consider.', 'Really enjoyed my weekend stay here, great location close to 6th street. Really nice building with friendly staff. Would stay here again on my next trip to Austin.', 'Would stay again! Great option for a kitchen and rooftop pool too. Grocery store is walkable and hosts are responsive. Only glitch we ran into was a national outage for the internet for a day but that was not in their control. Hosts were very responsive during this time. I used my phone as a hotspot for a meeting and got 5G with Verizon in the area.', 'This was a great spot - awesome value for a big condo in the heart of Rainey St. The rooftop pool during these hot summer days in Austin was the icing on the cake for the place — and also loved the bar that had food and drinks! There were other amenities (gym, yoga studio) that we didn’t use that looked great as well. Instructions for check-in and check-out for easy and communicated early. We really enjoyed our stay for my 30th!', 'Great place', 'Had a great weekend stay in this unit! On 17th floor with view of the highway, but lake view is possible if you visit the roof. Very responsive hosts, and the building is right near the bike/walking trail along the lake. Coffee cafe downstairs was great! Building staff were very accommodating for holding our luggage for free as well since our flight was later in the evening. Overall would visit again.', ""The building overall is great, they have a bar where you can coffee, a quick snack, or beers & cocktails. It's a few minutes walk to Rainey street which has lots of options for bars and socializing. The pool option was perfect for the super warm mornings or to watch the bats roam the skies during sunsets. The building staff was very friendly.\nHost is responsive on text and was able to easily accommodate my late check in. Apartment was clean and spacious, overall modern which was nice."", ""I called Airbnb about the extra charge and apparently this venue isn't supposed to be charging outside the app without approval. We wanted to stay here and didn't check early enough to line up somewhere else to stay so we just paid for it and got over it. The place is nice with a HUGE bathroom. There are stains on the sheets and rugs. When we got there, the place had dirty towels all over the bathroom, full trash cans, and dirty dishes. The building wouldn't come clean until we sent photos to prove that there was a mess. We asked for a refund on our cleaning fee and they told us they wouldn't because the cleaners eventually came and took care of it the next day. The location was great though and had lots of available amenities."", 'real sick place, would definitely stay again', 'Spacious and peaceful, with a beautiful view of the sunrise. Not much character in the space, though.

Will definitely stay again.', 'Great location, host communicated frequently and had someone meet us with keys. Would stay again!', 'Great location, stayed for two nights. It was close enough to great eats and night life but also far enough from all the noise. I decided to Uber everywhere as opposed to renting a car since it was $40/day for parking, and this worked out just fine. Check-in instructions were easy to follow, but it was unfornate that the pool was closed on Monday for maintenence (I did not find this out until a couple days prior to my trip). Overall a good experience.', 'Such a great place! It was super clean and conveniently located to Rainey St. and Lady Bird Lake. Overlooked the highway, but it was pretty quiet - never bothered by the traffic. The bed was incredibly comfortable. Would absolutely stay again!', 'Absolutely stunning unit, more on the private side! 10/10', 'We absolutely loved this booking! it is easy to get to and in a great location! It was clean and comfortable! The 17th floor view was not of the lake, as in the picture. That said I was entertained watching planes fly in, the beautiful morning, afternoon, and evening skyline. All correspondence was prompt and helpful.\nI would note the following things for future guests to be aware of....\n1) I paid for parking at $40/day. (which was steep i thought, but what do i know lol) The valets were friendly and prompt.\n2) The elevators during checkout/checkin hours were (as in many hotels) a bit of a hassle. ie. One day we helped a lady holding her dog and a dog crate walk down 17 flights of stairs (due to waiting a crazy amount of time for the elevator to finally stop and repeatedly be full). It is what it is, but plan accordingly. :)\n3) It seemed there were a lot of fees. ie $120 for cleaning fee.\nOverall, one of my all time favorite rentals!!', 'the stay was good, would like to stay again.', ""Very clean apartment with all the amenities you could need in the building and unit. Location is great too with decently walkable access to the city's main spots.\nQuite impersonal for an airbnb, no real introduction to the city, a cleaning fee alongside cleaning instructions at checkout, plus a required hefty 3rd party deposit. A little bit mechanical in style, but in the end it is a nice place that facilitated a very fun trip!"", 'The building was beautiful. Everything was very clean and modern. It even smelled spa like throughout. The location was great for walking, no need to rent or have a vehicle. The Bird scooters took us to father areas of the city easily. The bed was comfortable, bathroom was huge and the kitchen had great pots/pans, everything you need. Loved not having to pack shampoo/conditioner or body wash. The Nespresso was a challenge to find pods for. Target has them, Royal Blue Grocery does not. There is a lot of new construction and revitalization going on around the condo & downtown. Sadly also a lot of homelessness. We felt a little unsure at night at first but travel in pairs and be aware of your surroundings and you’re good to go. The fitness center was great. They could use a TV to play their Peloton yoga videos in their Yoga room though. The pool was freezing, heard the heater is broken. Would definitely come back to stay again.', 'Nice location, comfortable property', 'It was an amazing experience and a well location, beautiful place and pretty good access to the hwy and walkable to everywhere, the valet parking if you driving it’s pretty convenient, door stuff super friendly. It’s a great place to stay ohhhh not to mention the view from the pool .', 'Lovely place, *amazing* rooftop pool, everything was really nice. Our only major complaint is that you can’t check in after 10pm by default, and we were only able to by paying a $50 fee, which was not clear at all from the listing and is very unusual and frustrating for a modern accommodation.', 'Wonderful stay!', 'Booked One Fine BnBs listing as a solo female traveler.

There are bus stops right in front. It was fairly quiet for a city apartment but you will hear some street noise because the building faces the main street.

Busstop 2 mins right outside apartment for no 3 and 5 mins up the road (go left at main road) forboth 3 + 803 buses).\nHe’s a generous host, helpful with food spots to eat and any problems I had he was quick to reply + solve. I was there for work from Scotland but for me having a quiet space that wasn’t just a bedroom in a hotel, sofa to relax and have decent breakfast me being vegetarian is a must. Bedroom is blackout for sleep, comfy & really quiet. Shut the bedroom door - it got chilly, closed was very warm. Has woodburner.\nAvoid the petrol station near by for buying food, milk, snacks etc. Very expensive.', 'Patrick was super responsive when needed and gave us great recommendations!

Having the kitchen to prep meals was useful, and the extra bathroom amenities he said we could use were very welcome!\nFor any two people looking into the place, keep in mind the bed is a full-sized, so you will be getting cozy. That said, it was incredibly comfortable.\nThe neighborhood gets some noise at night, though the a/c is what vibrated through the walls, but it's about average for a place in the middle of the city.\nAll in all, it was a fantastic place to rest our feet!"", 'Great spot centrally located. Downtown is walkable', 'Great location and host response time was always prompt!', ""We've stayed here before and will stay here again.

Would definitely stay here again.', 'Place is located in a prime spot. A lot of outdoorsy and city things to do. The apartment itself is like a $600/month one bed room apartment. It seems to be used by the host for regular living and still contains all the persons stuff including comic posters all over the wall. The whole time it felt like I was house sitting a college boys apartment. The bed is like Star Wars themed with very mid comfortability. Honestly great place to be solo traveling, if with significant other try and find prettier spot. There is a pool which was pretty but other than that what you bring with you is what you get. And lastly bring towels and hygiene equipment. Don’t expect to find them at the bnb. Also don’t drive downtown just uber or walk (30 mins) you won’t find parking.', 'Convenient.

We enjoyed the balcony. It was a nice outdoor space for coffee and breakfast.\nThe bedroom and bathroom is a bit small and the unit is a little outdated.

Would definitely stay there again.', 'Great location in the city, walking distance to most things you need. there was, however, a permanent resident with mental health issues who yelled into the courtyard/pool area the entire time. lots of it was inappropriate and offensive. he did this nearly every single day until all hours of the morning, at the top of his lungs. I spoke to several residents who were having a hard time with this, to the point cops no longer respond. they are trying to have him moved to a better location for him and those around. despite this fact, I would stay here again, Patrick was a great host, and the apartment was fantastic.', 'Stayed in Austin for 2 weeks and Patrick was a fantastic host.

Easy enough to lyft into he downtown area and Barton springs pool. The apartment is just the right size for 2-3 ppl. Would be good for a longer stay also. I only stayed 3 nights. The apartment within the complex was a bit tricky to find but other than that this was a good stay! Didn’t know what to do with the keys so just returned it to the lockbox. As an experienced air bnb renter this was obvious but some ppl don’t have common sense. As didn’t know the rules for recycling so I also left that in the kitchen counter.

Zilker is a good neighborhood with a lot of restaurants and close-ish to Lady Bird Lake and downtown. It's not super walkable to many things though so be prepared to drive or Uber. The apartment is pretty bare bones. It was professionally cleaned but it is pretty outdated, so didn't appear super clean. Also, be prepared to eat out for every meal because there aren't real dishes or cookware in the apartment. We also had an issue with the kitchen sink backing up and the smell was pretty bad...I think this was probably a one-off situation and Patrick was quick to communicate about it but it was pretty gross and never got fixed the entire week we were there."", 'Cute little one bed apartment!

Do yourself a favor - make a reservation at Odd Duck and shell out the cash for the burger. It’s righteous. The apartment isn’t spacious, but perfect for one or two people if you’re more interested in exploring Austin than sitting around inside. Patrick is a great host - responsive and very helpful.

The kitchen sink broke second night, was never fix for the remainder for my 8 night stay. The host was very responsive to messages, but was unable to have the landlord come fix the sink.

Want to enjoy more time outside? Town Lake is a few blocks away with a lakeside trail and kayaking/paddleboarding (rent a bike from Trek nearby.)

There is lots of construction but Austin is always building a new skyscraper so we were not surprised or bothered by construction noise or traffic noise.

It was also very convenient to have appliances such as microwave and dishwasher to use at our disposal. And the AC worked phenomenal, which we loved (especially in this heat!)\nHowever, all 3 remotes for both TV’s were dead. (We used the Roku app on our phone to control them.) The ceiling fan and light in the bedroom was also out of order/not working and the lamp in the living room had issues as well. The faucet in the bathroom’s tub is broken, and we struggled to turn the water off and on. The shower curtain definitely needs replacing- it is very dirty.

Shower knob was also finicky to work with. We would stay again.', ""This apartment was kind of bare bones, but it was priced that way as well. Everything was mostly as expected. Two things were a little out of whack though.\nThe first might just be that I've been lucky with most of my rentals. And that was that the kitchen had pretty much nothing in it. Not even bad coffee. I don't think the listing claimed that it would, but I've become accustomed to Airbnb kitchens being stocked with at least the very basics. So as no as you know that going in, no issues.\nSecond, there was tv on a table in the living room. I went to turn it on and realized it wasn't plugged in. When I looked closer, it was in a spot that didn't have a socket so it actually couldn't be plugged in. Not sure if a previous renter had moved it or what, but that left the only functioning tv in the bedroom."", ""Place was great on the inside and the pictures were accurate, everything worked as expected.

A few dishes were obviously put away dirty. Living tv was not functional.\nThe bed was very comfortable, and the AC was blasting. August in Austin - that’s a big plus. Very friendly neighborhood/ neighbors.\nThere were a few intimate or personal items that were left. Not sure if it’s the owners or from the last guests.

We will definitely be back.', 'the space was absolutely gorgeous and very unique, we were huge fans of the record player and the Miles Davis and John Coltrane options, the tub and shower were fantastic and boy I cannot say enough about that pool. the location is great and the host was quite friendly. Really there were only two issues that kept it from a perfect five: the first was that there was all this beautiful coffee and tea equipment but only a couple of worn out tea bags, no cream option and one old packet of stevia, which was a bit of a bummer, and the second was that there were supposed to be accessible streaming services on the TV in the living room and we had some issues getting the sound on the record player.

The retreat is an upstairs unit at the back of a few other rentals, even though his properties stay sold out we never saw another person except Bill. It was nice to know he was there if we needed ANYTHING. The layout of the property keeps it very private. Bills place is more of a lux boutique hotel than Airbnb and we loved it! The pool of course is the highlight of this place. I enjoyed the pool temp and the patio furniture for lounging. (A few tears in the cushions, but I threw a towel over no big deal) The retreat was decorated with vintage furniture and eclectic art which fits the Austin Vibe. The rugs in the unit were a bit aged and warped, but again not a deal breaker. Super comfortable bed, A/C works great, shower has awesome pressure.

I truly couldn’t ask for more.', 'The location was awesome. Loved being centralized to everything we planned on visiting. The feel of the place was nostalgic. The bed was a bit uncomfortable but not so much that I lost any sleep. There were snacks for us in the kitchen area which came in handy. Thank you for that Lisa. The shower is gorgeous but the water pressure is pretty low. Likely for water conservation purposes. There were towels but they were kind of rough. Lisa was prompt with communication and offered to address any issues we brought to her attention. She is amazing. Overall a great stay. I rated the overall stay 4 stars for 2 reasons. 1.) There was a smell when we initially walked into the house. Likely due to either using scent free cleaning items or little air circulation before we checked in. It was muggy when we arrived so the weather could have contributed. 2.) The AC unit was dirty. When we turned it on, dirt fell out. This could have also contributed to the smell. Lisa was prompt in addressing this tho', 'Great place to stay', 'Great location!', 'We loved this cottage. It was clean and nicely decorated. Great location to restaurants and events.', 'This space is in the perfect location.

The bed was super comfortable. It had everything you needed. The neighborhood was super cute and we really enjoyed looking at all the different styles of homes in the area. The location was perfect, about a 10-min walk from the bus stop that worked best for us to get downtown. The Arbor Food Truck park was a 5 min-walk away and absolutely amazing. Cafe Corazon behind the cemetery was one of the best coffee shops we’ve been to. We would stay at Lisa’s again in a heartbeat!', 'Lisa’s place was a great spot to stay at for a Longhorn’s game. It was a 20 min walk to the stadium and was close to some good restaurants and bars.\nEnough beds to sleep at least 5, but living room space accommodates three to four adults.\nLisa is a great communicator and we had a great stay.', 'Everything was great! The airbnb is just like the pictures, very comfortable, clean, and has everything you’d need. The neighborhood felt really peaceful and safe, and also very accessible.

The house is well stocked with everything you may need - paper towels, seasonings, etc. The TVs also have streaming options (Roku in the living room and Amazon in the bedroom). It is in a very quiet location and while we couldn't walk to everything we wanted to, it was close enough to venture out for meals. Even when we had to drive, everything was within 15 minutes. The best thing about this location was the host. They had some work being done to the house prior to our arrival and it tripped a circuit breaker for the hot water heater. We didn't know until 9:30 PM that we didn't have hot water. I messaged Lisa, she responded right away and got us taken care of. In addition, the clean up she expected was very reasonable. I've been to some places where the host leaves a list of things you have to clean before leaving. Not here - just do the dishes and take out the trash if it gets full. Would highly recommend this place."", 'Lisa is an amazing host and an excellent communicator! Her place was exactly as described in the listing, spotless, spacious and in a convenient location.

A total of four large white towels were in the bathroom. After asking, William stated that two of these were for the pool. In saying that, they only left 2 Tide pods for laundry for a 4 day stay. The liquid bathroom soap in the container was not replenished and ran out on the 2nd day. There were no courtesy toiletries left in case you forgot something. The bed was very comfortable with linen sheets. Very little storage for clothes- nothing substantial for a longer stay. In the kitchen, every appliance needed. Again, no courtesy touches such as bottled water, welcoming snacks. There were dishes left in the dishwasher. Couch was comfy. TV service provided was not user friendly. Moving on to the rooftop pool- gorgeous. Cons: pool not monitored- dog running around, kids playing football, horseplay. Pool small for size of bldg.']",['4 guests · 1 bedroom · 2 beds · 1 bath'],https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/627658938698243818?adults=1&children=0&enable_m3_private_room=true&infants=0&pets=0&search_mode=regular_search&check_in=2024-11-30&check_out=2024-12-05&source_impression_id=p3_1729616487_P3LKwtQxANpYiq8g&previous_page_section_name=1000&federated_search_id=20ccc806-ff86-4daa-80a6-c96153d1edc5

I checked Airbnb and found this reasonably priced option that is a short Uber from Moody Center. Yes it’s small but if you just need a place to sleep & unwind it’s a great option. The house is tidy & comfy. The outside patio had a fire pit but it was too warm to want to use it. My only suggestion to make the experience better would be to mow the grass because I think that would help with mosquitoes, which were abundant outside.

The view from the living area is a parking lot, with a direct view in from anyone parking their car. Doesn't feel too safe.

The location is great, though be warned that rideshare apps seem to have much difficulty with finding the unit address. This was frustrating; I would recommend walking out of the entire complex and then calling for your ride.\nOverall, this listing is suitable if you are looking for a cheap place in a good location.

It was also nice being able to walk by the chicken coop across the alley each morning. There's even a bunny in there!\nThe place was clean where it mattered the most, but was missing on the details. When sitting on the couch, you could see dust and some crumbs on the kitchenette counter from a previous guest. Bathroom walls also needed some attention, as there were some dead bugs, likely smashed dead by previous guests.\nThere are indeed some yippy dogs next door who I assume the host has no control over. They aren't barking constantly, but they woke us up early one morning. And the AC vibrates the wall at times, which is annoying when trying to sleep."", 'Exactly as the pictures and perfect location!

I'm aware that SXSW was on - and therefore prices were bumped up, however I ended up paying $2,615 NZD for 7 nights (total). The size of the room was very small once I had my suitcase in there. I stored my clothes in the draws next to the bed which all became quite musty over the course of the week. I'm also very allergic to cats, there was a number of times I wanted to leave the door open to let some fresh air in but the cat kept running into the room and walking over my belongings. Therefore, I had to keep the door shut and it seemed like there was no window or ventilation in the bathroom (unless I missed it?) which meant the place felt damp. There were also no curtains on the window above the bed which made it difficult to sleep in (had jetlag) The place has only had excellent reviews so I was expecting a better stay for what I paid."", 'Great stay!

You will not regret staying with Jennifer. She is very communicative and offers great suggestions for your stay in Austin."", 'I was in town for a convention, and was so lucky to find Jennifer’s place. It was tucked in a beautiful yard, quiet and peaceful overnight, but an easy walk to and from the convention center downtown with coffee and breakfast on the way (I loved Flat Track, Dark Horse and Cenote). After a long convention day, it was lovely to grab some groceries on my way back and eat dinner with the tortoise and Monkey the cat. Jennifer was a great host; I loved her recommendations and enjoyed chatting. The bed was super comfy and the AC kept the casita cool and comfortable. I am sensitive to smells, and appreciated that the bedding was clean and fresh, but not heavily perfumed with dryer sheets or other masking scents.', 'This is a delightful and cozy place located in a great part of town.

Very peaceful and perfect for my solo trip to Austin at a great price! The hosts were great and made sure I was accommodated.', ""I adored staying at this cute cottage-style Airbnb, largely due to the setting because Jennifer lives with several friendly and adorable animals, including two goats and a giant tortoise. I even encountered the lovely neighbourhood black cat, Mars, who greeted me with nuzzles.\nJennifer was very communicative throughout my stay and was able to accommodate several requests, including: granting my request to remove one night's stay just several days before my arrival, helping me set up the air conditioner and heater, and also extending my checkout time by half an hour.\nMy only issue was that a couple of the items in the cottage were old and therefore were delicate. For example, one of the curtain rods fell out of the wall when I tugged the curtain gently (fortunately, Jennifer was understanding when I told her about the rod). Also, the toilet clogged a little when I flushed it even though there was nothing obstructing the pipes whatsoever.\nOther than that, I highly recommend staying here! The neighbourhood is safe and comfortable. You're also close to a lot of great bars and restaurants."", ""Jennifer's place was great! it was exactly as described and a perfect spot to hang out for the weekend."", 'This place was so awesome. The room itself was small, but cozy, very private, and it perfectly fit our needs. The property was an absolute dream! Walking distance to tons of bars, restaurants, and shopping. PLUS there are goats! and a tortoise!\nJennifer was lovely and easy to communicate with. We will definitely try to stay here again next time we are in Austin!', ""Somewhat disappointed because of two main reasons.\nFirstly though, Jennifer, as a host was great. She was very responsive and friendly.\nThe cottage is absolutely fine for a couple for a few days, although the bed is the smallest double bed size. The bed was quite old but reasonably comfortable. I felt the bedding was a bit old too.\nThe main issues were that three windows did not have curtains / blinds so I was lying there at night with a small window about a foot from my head and an uncomfortable feeling incase someone was looking in (highly unlikely as it was a corner of the garden, but still I could see the shadows of the trees at night). It also meant the cottage became light at 6am with sunrise.\nThe other issue was that the aircon unit is quite old and I had to leave it on during the day to try to make the room somewhat cool on my return. I couldn't use the aircon overnight as it was super noisy and at least than two feet from my pillow and head there was no way I could sleep through that noise. The outside air temp during the day got up to 105 degrees so the room was extremely hot too so it was tough to sleep there (these cottages are simple wood so don't have insulation to keep any cool in, or heat out).\nThose two issues aside, for people who really like the quirkiness of Austin will appreciate the other qualities of this cottage room. I was able to walk to the conference centre in about 12 minutes and the homeless people enroute were not a problem"", ""It was a very sweet little spot, and the hosts were very kind. There was so much to do around us, so we weren't around much, but it was a nice space to retreat to. Thanks for having us!"", 'super peaceful! i felt right at home', 'This small cottage is a wonderful and peaceful location that is just a few blocks away from the city. The two goats and small garden add to the naturistic vibe. Great place for two people with necessities provided with small kitchenware and bathroom supplies. The host is quick to answer and super friendly.', ""Really enjoyed our time in Austin using Jennifer's cottage as a base for our adventures. Jennifer is super friendly and highly accommodating. This is a great location for nearby food spots and very walkable to many locations. I would absolutely stay here again."", 'This place was the cutest ""old Austin"" spot.

Highly highly recommend this', ""Staying at Jennifer's is a lot of fun. The home is well accommodated and comfortable.

I recommend Dark Horse Tattoo for a good cup of coffee and kind friends. Overall an awesome place to stay!"", 'Jennifer’s property was a little slice of paradise in Austin.

Exceptional comfort, guaranteeing a restful sleep.\nMy stay wasn't without its challenges—I accidentally booked one night instead of two. I was so sad to leave.

They have lots of thoughtful consumables from toothpaste to shower aroma spray. One thing to note, and this may be in the base description, but no dogs are allowed on the bed. I don’t consider this a drawback, but the bed is low, and if your pet is used to it I could see it being an issue.

Would definitely stay again in the future ❤️', 'Casa Chalmers was the perfect place for my family to spend the holidays. It’s always a pleasant surprise when the house is even better than the pictures and that was exactly the case. It’s perfectly styled, clean, well laid out, and had everything we needed. I loved that the bedrooms were upstairs so that after we put our toddler to bed (we set up our travel crib) my husband and I could hang out downstairs without being too worried about waking her up. I know everyone mentioned the robes in the reviews but I literally ordered myself one before leaving. While I came with my family this time I’d absolutely stay again if I can back with friends. The en-suite bathrooms plus the half bath downstairs would make it so easy for all my girlfriends to get ready!\nCase Chalmers is perfectly located to everything we wanted to see and do. It was an easy drive to South Congress, to great parks, and to the children’s museum. There was always parking available on the street.', 'This was the perfect getaway for the long weekend!

The mattresses are some of the most comfortable I’ve slept on. Elizabeth is super fast at responding. Had a great stay, would come again.', ""Very chic place! Great water pressure in the shower, soft lush bedding. The kitchen was great, we didn't cook but I think it'd be a great space to cook in. Loved the front and back porch for a coffee or wine.

Plenty of bars, restaurants and coffee shops in the area! It had all of your essential needs - kitchen supplies, iron, hair dryer, etc. We parked on the street in front of the house without any issues over a period of 3 days. Just a heads up, bring a wash cloth or loofah to bathe with. There aren’t any in the house. I’d definitely stay again.', ""We had such a great stay at Elizabeth's place. The place is located at a really nice area of Austin 10 mins walk to 6th street which has all the restaurants and bars (few cute coffee shops are located even closer). The neighbourhood is very quiet and the place was just perfect for me and my girlfriend to relax after a long day of exploring Austin. We especially liked the 2 bathrooms which made it flexible for the two of us. The beds were super comfy and there were also a few refreshments in the fridge for us. Elizabeth was such a great host, proactively reaching out to us and responding very quickly to anything that we might have needed. The AC was really quiet (I'm especially a light sleeper but I didn't mind it this time). Would recommend to anyone who's visiting Austin and wants to have a solid base camp for all the explorations."", 'Definitely stay here!

Location was convenient with plenty of walkable locations nearby or accessible by a quick Uber drive. Thanks again, Elizabeth!', 'My group enjoyed our stay at Elizabeth’s place. It’s a beautiful, new home that’s wonderfully decorated. The location is also great, as it’s within a 5 minute drive of some of the most popular bars and restaurants in Austin, as well as Lady Bird Lake and Downtown. Only issue we had was that the bowls were dirty when we took them off of the shelf to use.', 'This place was perfect for two couples. Parking just outside the house on the street was never an issue. The neighborhood felt safe and was quiet. We especially appreciated the location as it was an easy walk/scooter ride/drive to a lot of different restaurants/coffee shops/breweries.

This place was an excellent location to walk to many things but also a quick car ride to so much else! The neighborhood and the street were not too busy.\nLoved coming back from a hot day to have separate showers in each of rooms! The house was well temperature controlled and very clean. We utilized the kitchen many times and it had everything we needed (ice in the freezer was great to have). The beds/pillows were very comfortable and the extra touches around the house felt very cozy.\nOur host was lovely and they even accommodated an earlier check-in for us that was requested.

The house had everything we needed, and more. very thoughtful touches throughout the house.\nI tend to stick to 2 rules with airbnb, don't rent space with no reviews and don't rent space with owners onsite. This space was a gamble and it was a lovely win. I never saw anyone, they live next door but never had them in our space, I have had many experiences where the owners end up in your space alot and that can feel overwhelming for me, when I am traveling. I did have fair amount of communication with Elizabeth and all was lovely and easy. The no reviews must be because this is a brand new space, it looks as though everything in the space is brand new.\nThe amount of great food and coffee within walking distance is great. I love staying in neighborhoods and this one delivers for sure. I would definitely stay here again.\nthank you and hopefully I find myself in Austin again."", 'This was such an awesome place to stay in Austin, in a great neighborhood. We had a great time and experience thank you!', 'We loved our stay at Elizabeth’s home. Squeaky clean with super comfy beds and a shower that felt spa-like.

Our only regret: wish we could’ve stayed longer.', 'Great place, location and host. Highly recommend', 'Great place and awesome host!', 'The house appears to be an ADU of a main home.

Perfect location for everything- Rainey, walking downtown, the lake, etc. The unit was very clean and perfect for a home base.\nWe did have an issue with the locks. The locks are electronic and you have to use a key card. After the first night it stopped working making it difficult to get in to our unit. At point point it took us 40 minutes to get in the door. We were in constant communication with the building and the hosts. The hosts were slow to respond at some points- 12+ hours at one point. The building decided to put a piece of tape over the door lock as a “solution”. This meant that our door was open all day when we were not there. They said that the building mandates they have that type of lock and there was nothing they could do about it. The building seemed safe but it was just unfortunate that there was a chance you could leave and come back to everything stolen.', 'Great rooftop area with stunning river views...great sunsets!

There is a great walk path that takes you to the other side of the city and it’s so convenient!\nAs for the stay, the host was super quick with responding! The unit was a perfect size for us two. The pool and bar inside were a plus as well. My ONLY complaint was I could tell someone had very recently stayed there. There was some cleaning missed such as hair left on top the shower drain and the carpet not being vacuumed well.

The location is good and we utilized the electric bikes on Rainey Street to get around the city.', 'AWESOME LOCATION! Great and comfortable stay with amazing amenities. Very clean and perfect space for solo travel or a couple. Keyless entry would make this stay better due to having to meet up with someone off site for the key upon arrival. Communication was very delayed but did appreciate the follow up. Would stay again!', 'Such a beautiful local condo/studio! Himesh was such a lovely and very responsive host!! It was such the perfect place for a quick get away and right around the corner from a very fun group of restaurants/bars. The gym was definitely a top 3 favorite!!

They said they would let the concierge team know, there was still one plugged in.\n- Kitchen cabinet fell apart, the problem was I unable to utilize the kitchen trash because I didn’t want the cabinet to come apart further. The concierge team said they’d let the owners know, I didn’t hear back & contacted the Airbnb hosts through the app & they said they’d let the concierge team know. Next day I received a message asking me how everything was without acknowledging it. I then received a message saying they let maintenance know with no other follow up.\n- I noticed a sewage smell right away especially around the area of the fridge. Now I know why the air freshener was likely left in.\nI wouldn’t stay here again but with the coffee shop on the first floor, location, low price I can see why it’s desirable.', 'Very nice for a get away with a high top condo view loved it!', 'From check in to check out our stay was relaxed and simple, the location was fantastic and the bnb itself was so clean and lovely to come back to after a long day in the sun.', 'Great location and the rooftop was way better than expected!

Despite the construction happening around we were able to navigate everything easily and thought it was a good spot to explore from.\nThe place was really nice inside! I will say it was a little tight for two people to work comfortably but we made it work.\nAlso, I would just say make sure you note that if you arrive after 9pm for check in you have to go to a separate location to get the key. Not the most convenient if you don’t have a car. It’s in the listing so no complaints about it but just reminder that it’s there. We were arriving just after 9 and had to the second location check in.\nThanks for everything!', 'Loved our stay! Perfect location loved the pool and the fun vibe there! Had everything we needed. Thanks for the great stay', 'I had an amazing stay in Austin and felt so comfortable and safe at this listing which is huge for a solo traveler like myself.

The views from the rooftop pool were absolutely gorgeous. I even had a chance to fit in a few workouts in the gym which was well equipped. My view from the unit was also very pleasant. For any future visitors considering this accommodation please note there’s a lot of construction happening just a heads up if that’s bothersome to you. Personally, it didn’t bother me and thought it was great to see a city thriving. I would 10/10 stay here again in the future.', 'This is my second time staying at Natiivo Austin! The location is perfect, the building is beautiful, and the pool is lovely! The hosts were very communicative and helpful. My one thing I think would be nice would be a keypad door.

Awesome condo and pool', 'Lovely apartment', ""Construction made it tricky for GPS to find, but the location was great for accessing the River trail. The place was very nice.

The place was just as described- perfect for someone traveling alone or for a couple. The front office staff was very friendly and helpful. The lobby and bar downstairs were beautiful and it really felt like walking into a luxury hotel each time. There are 3 elevators that move at top speed so you never felt like you were waiting around to get to your room. Also, the room is on the 10th floor- same as the fitness center which was a plus.\nIt was walking distance to a grocery shop, an awesome whiskey bar, and of course, Rainey St. There’s a lot of construction in the area but it never affected us from our room and it was not difficult to get Ubers.\nThe hosts were very responsive, accommodating, and friendly. I would definitely trust any place hosted by them.\nThe pool was very crowded on a Saturday and definitely small for the amount of people it’s servicing. But it’s open till midnight so I guess you can try different days/times.\nOverall it was a great stay!', 'The concierge team and host were very communicative prior, during and after our stay.

There was construction going on but you honestly couldn't even tell noise wise!"", 'The condo is located in the Rainey st area. It is right by the running trails that run along side of the lake/river. The building was great with the exception of the elevators which were partially out of service when we were there.

Location can’t be beat', 'This is one of those Airbnb-as-investment-property experiences. An old apartment building refinished to look good in the photos at minimum cost. They’ll refuse to tell you which unit you’re staying in prior to check-in day “for security reasons” (I was trying to mail a package), threaten to charge your credit card $75 per 15 minutes that you remain after their early 10am checkout, and then push you to leave a 5-star review “for the family business” upon checkout. Rather distasteful: you’re a wallet, not a guest. For the price, you’d be better off staying in one of the nearby hotels and receiving actual hospitality.\nThings that were good: Blazing fast internet. Spotlessly clean (though the stripped concrete floors are cold on the feet—bring slippers). The stripped concrete floors, general lack of art on the walls, and smell of disinfectant all combine to feel rather soulless. But, the location is great, the parking is free, and I suppose for a longer stay it’s nice to have a kitchen.', 'Lisa was incredibly responsive and helpful, messaging back immediately when needed.

Despite Airbnb's standard identity checks, Alex required an additional third-party verification process involving personal photos and a background check, which felt unnecessarily intrusive. To make matters worse, I wasn’t given the option to cancel after being informed of these unexpected fine-print rules. I was only offered a partial credit, not a full refund, if I didn’t agree with the rules, effectively forcing me into what Alex wanted.\nAs a frequent Airbnb user, I’ve never encountered such an experience. The unit itself didn’t match the listing—broken blinds compromised our privacy, and it wasn’t the advertised condo but a basic apartment. Had I known this upfront, I would have never stayed. The booking process took more time and effort than the stay itself, and the entire experience was frustrating, misleading, and unreasonably demanding."", 'Great place and great location, really near downtown and other things', ""Alex's place worked out great!

Long driveway and needed to drive backwards to get to street. If you need something, host will provide.

We appreciated it very much.', ""The place is as described in the publication. It's in a very good area, close to Franklin BBQ and downtown. Everything clean, tidy and equipped with all the necessary things. Apart from they have an air purifier that comes spectacular for the studio that has kitchen and bed in the same room. the only thing not so comfortable is the parking that is narrow if you rent a suv (as was our case) But there is parking place on the street, and being quiet and safe nothing happens when leaving it there. with which I do not see it as an inconvenience."", 'Really enjoyed our stay in Austin!

It was within close walking distance to several restaurants, bars, ice cream shops, cafes, and stores. There were parks nearby and it was a very close drive to downtown. The apartment itself was a little run down and lacked interior, but we weren't there much so it wasn't a big deal.

The only negative feedback I have is don\'t expect to cook more than spaghetti in the kitchen. There was 1 knife, which was a steak knife and it was very difficult to chop anything -just the absolute basics in the kitchen but it was very clean!

Highly recommend!', 'Overall, I would not rent this unit again. Hosts were responsive, location was great. However the unit was extremely minimal. There were no cozy/thoughtful touches. A total of four large white towels were in the bathroom. After asking, William stated that two of these were for the pool. In saying that, they only left 2 Tide pods for laundry for a 4 day stay. The liquid bathroom soap in the container was not replenished and ran out on the 2nd day. There were no courtesy toiletries left in case you forgot something. The bed was very comfortable with linen sheets. Very little storage for clothes- nothing substantial for a longer stay. In the kitchen, every appliance needed. Again, no courtesy touches such as bottled water, welcoming snacks. There were dishes left in the dishwasher. Couch was comfy. TV service provided was not user friendly. Moving on to the rooftop pool- gorgeous. Cons: pool not monitored- dog running around, kids playing football, horseplay. Pool small for size of bldg.']",['4 guests · 1 bedroom · 2 beds · 1 bath'],https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/627658938698243818?adults=1&children=0&enable_m3_private_room=true&infants=0&pets=0&search_mode=regular_search&check_in=2024-11-30&check_out=2024-12-05&source_impression_id=p3_1729616477_P364lkBJ0TqZmeIy&previous_page_section_name=1000&federated_search_id=bb8e6898-b5ff-4b7a-ac11-c9e061d89d15

Will definitely stay again next time!', ""We stayed with Vacasa for a week-long trip to Austin. The staff inside and outside the building were very friendly, and so were the guests. We were steps away from the hike and bike trail, paddle board rentals, B Cycle stations, Rainey St, and more easy paths to East Austin/Downtown/6th St. It was a great escape from the Texas heat by going to the pool, lobby bar/coffee counter, or relaxing on the balcony. We utilized the in-unit laundry and full kitchen. Plenty of rideshares available and the valet looked really nice although we didn't bring our vehicle. We would stay with Vacasa again and had a terrific time in Austin."", 'Very clean. Loved the patio and view. Great gym amd beautiful rooftop pool.

The team is responsive and the cafe is a nice touch.', 'Loved everything about our stay', 'This unit was wonderful and exactly as pictured. The building is lovely and the reps at the desk and valet were always so friendly. The unit was the best-stocked Air BNB we’ve used. It had hand soap, laundry detergent, extra blankets and more. The view was wonderful, it faces north and views extend from downtown to 35. The shade was easy to use and blocked light pretty well, even if you want to map during the day. I never communicated with Vacasa for this particular unit, they sent clear instructions before we arrived and never had any issues that warranted further communication. The location currently has a lot of construction. We still walked to Rainey St and beyond and it didn’t bother us. You can hear it slightly from the unit but again, it didn’t bother us. Especially with the tv on, you barely hear it. We would stay here again and highly recommend.', 'Five stars all around. I would strongly recommend staying here. I saw complaints of the elevator being slow it was not an issue at all. The unit has a breath taking view from the 27th floor naturally it will take a few seconds to get to that floor. If you’re thinking of staying here stop thinking and just do it.', ""amazing place and amazing facilities.

The space is small, as expected for a studio, so we really felt like we paid for the view. Amenities were nice but couldn’t enjoy the pool much because there was lots of people. Not sure if it was because of the time we were there (Memorial day Weekend) or if it’s always that crowded but that was the only downside of the stay. Host were very responsive and the Vacasa representative was super friendly and helpful. Valet parking was a bit pricey but super convenient and the staff had amazing customer service.', 'Great spot to stay in. Note that we had to reach out to customer support to get coffee pods as they were missing, but they were responsive!', 'great place to stay', 'The view from this room was amazing you can see both sunrise and sunset. The room itself came equipped with a full kitchen and had a very modern feel. Great for a weekend trip or if you’re traveling for work. It is also a little less than a half mile from rainy st. And even closer to a mini grocery store. The pool was nice but I have to say a bit small and each day we had to wait around for chairs to become available. But amazing sunset view! I also liked that the room had washer and dryer! I would say the only downside is how hot the room would get at night even with the AC at 70 which is 4 degrees cooler then we keep our home in HTX it still woke us up out of our sleep. As well as this room can truly only accommodate 2 people. Contrary to the listing though the bed is a full size not a queen and also not very comfortable. Which probably didn’t help with how hot it was. But overall would probably stay again for a quick 1-2 night trip', 'Great location, awesome view from the balcony.

He said he would request the fee right after we checked in but we did not get one until the day after we left. Then he sent multiple request for the pet fee despite having 48hrs to pay. With 24hrs on the request left, he changed the reasoning from pet fee to damages sending a pic of us checking in with the dog. We were bombarded by pay requests and dms upon our arrival back home. That undermined our intention from the BEGINNING to pay him- which we swiftly did. Once we asked him why the fee was changed, he said there were no damages?

Clean, bright, and excellent communication from María. Highly recommend!', ""I've always wanted to stay in a tiny house; this one was everything I dreamed of! Aesthetic, minimal, clean. Just enough. Elevated. And good location. 3 min. walk to Greater Goods Coffee Co.! 10 min. walk to the Colorado River. (Wake up early if you want to walk downtown without sweating too much, but totally do-able.) Felt like MY home for the weekend. Would stay again! Do recommend! This was my first Airbnb stay, and it was a great one. Thanks, Samuel!"", 'I stayed here for 3 weeks for work purposes. The WiFi is very unpredictable—sometimes it works and sometimes it can’t hold a Zoom call. It’s really a mystery as to why/when it decides to cooperate. It was disappointing that the space was not nearly as clean as it seemed to be from other reviews. I found hair in the bed, towels, etc and noticeable food crumbs and bugs throughout. The host was always responsive, which was helpful to remedy the cleanliness issue. The location was the only saving grace. Close to so many great ships, bars, restaurants, etc.', 'Always wanted to stay in a tiny house and this did not disappoint. Loved every moment here!', 'Our stay overall was enjoyable. Samuel’s a great host and was quick to respond to our messages. The home is very tight for 3 people and would be ideal for a couple. It’s also a great location! Near a few bars and an HEB. A 10 min or so drive downtown or to Rainey St where all the lively bars are. It’s also a great option if you’re planning on staying in Austin for the Grand Prix.', 'We just adored our stay at the tiny house. Everything is updated and modern, it’s like we were in a magazine! The air conditioner is totally sufficient on hot days and the TV is perfectly placed for late night shows and snuggles. There are two gates to go through so the property feels really private. Possibly the best part about this place is the location - there’s so many good spots a very short distance away - breweries, bars, coffee shops, restaurants etc. We felt so connected to the city! Samuel really thought of everything, we loved his PDF of recommended places to eat and drink in Austin. We would absolutely book again!\nThanks Samuel!', 'The place sufficed for my boyfriends and my necessities. The bed and couch were super comfortable, the place is lovely, pretty accents and great amenities. Located in a nice neighborhood, within walking distance to coffee shops and restaurants. Couldn’t have asked for more. Highly recommend this one.', ""Samuel's place was great! We initially booked another one of Samuel's places, but we needed to extend another day last minute. Unfortunately, we were unable to extend at the originally booked place because of another booking, but Samuel was very accommodating and offered a stay at one of his other airbnbs. He was super helpful and responsive with trying to book the other location even though he was busy at work. We really appreciated him working with us last minute. This place and location was great and I will definitely book another one of Samuel's places again especially because of his willingness to help."", 'Comfortable and quiet place to stay within a short walking distance to the restaurants and bars on 6th St. Host was very communicative with instructions and recommendations.', ""Great, quiet location. Amazing, helpful, and communicative host. Clean and cute with all the amenities needed. AC works great in the Austin heat! TV was perfect with all the right streaming platforms. They included fun books about Austin too. I would say it's best for a single person or two max, as it is a TINY house. I would highly recommend and stay here again.\nTwo things to note, just since it's a new AirBnb: 1. I would not stay here if you have injuries or mobility issues. You have to climb up a small, high ladder to get to the sleeping loft. It may be dangerous if you are compromised or have anyone in your party who is. Otherwise, this works perfect, you just have to be careful. 2. The shower body wash/ conditioner/ shampoo holders in the shower are wall-mounted and aren't labeled; so they all kind of look the same. Look inside the bottles under the sink first to see what's what. I also let the owner know that this is an issue, so they may label them soon. If not, just a helpful pre-shower tip.\nEnjoy Austin!"", 'Comfortable and clean space, worked out well. I look forward to a future stay.', 'Sam did a really good job of letting me know what needed to be done and when as well as any other possible concerns I had.', 'Our stay was awesome! Everything was as described and clean. Sam responded fast to our concerns with the ac and got it fixed right away! Will have to book again in the future', ""The tiny house was perfect for the two of us! It is surprisingly spacious, has lots of natural light, is clean/well-maintained, and had everything we needed for our week in Austin. The location is amazing - close to everything on the East Side but on a quiet street with plenty of street parking. We were able go out for food and drinks at night or get to bed early without the noisiness of the bars keeping us up. I highly recommend visiting Canje and Whislers which are ~10min walk away. Also Buenos Aires is a 5min drive down 6th and has always been one of my faves - the empanadas with chimichurri are incredible. The home is at a great spot for getting around the city and avoiding the I-35 traffic, plus the drive to the airport only takes ~15mins. Our hosts and their doggo were super friendly and made us feel at home during our stay.

Parking on the street was never an issue, the gate was easy to access, and I loved the privacy. I felt safe and secure, and so clean! Excellent water pressure in the shower. I needed nothing more! Maria was incredibly helpful to assist with allowing me a slightly earlier check-in to coordinate a long work day. I would absolutely love to stay here again on future Austin visits!

This place feels so clean and cozy (and surprisingly spacious), equipped with everything one could hope for to make it feel like home. And the location is incredible! You’re close enough to both the airport and downtown to feel central to everything with minimal traffic. (It took me just twelve minutes to get to an ACL concert.) And yet, you’re still far enough out where you can experience cool, offbeat local areas (there’s an Ethiopian diner nearby that I’d highly recommend) or just kickback and take a peaceful breather (the neighborhood itself is so nice and quiet).

Would definitely stay again!', 'This is a great spot for a short stay in Austin.\nIt has solid kitchen amenities and is comfortable for 1-2 people space wise.

Location is quiet but close to lots of great restaurants and activities.\nThe listing, in my mind, isn’t super accurate to describe it as an entire bungalow. It is one of two? three? units that are a part of a bungalow style building. This isn’t a problem except the very large windows and sliding doors face the other unit. Your only options are to close all the curtains for privacy or risk folks walking by at any time and having a full floor to ceiling view into your space. Otherwise there are some things that I would look for to rate 5 stars: more towels, a cover on the comforter that could be washed between guests, a more well kept and comfortable outdoor area. The furnishings and space are starting to look a bit worn or need a deeper clean.', 'A perfect spot for a quick Austin getaway!

Full kitchen, linens, house keeping products and even a few snacks and drinks.\nThey were very responsive, with clear instructions. I’d definitely stay here again if I’m coming back to visit.

From reservation to departure, they didn't miss a step. They allowed us an early check-in because we got into town ahead of schedule. And then offered for us to check out a bit later if we needed the time. The place is a retreat-like oasis, and the balcony is not to be missed! We were in town for ACL, and it was super convenient to get to the festival, but also offered a respite from all the crowds. I can't recommend this spot highly enough. We will be back!"", ""The place was cozy and spacious for two guests. I really appreciate how they left snacks and a couple bottles of wine. The furniture and decor complimented the Airbnb but the focal point was the shower and that mesmerizing blue color, I've never spent so much time in a shower before until then.

The apartment had been cleaned, so there seems to be no way the owner didn't know about this problem, but instead of taking the place offline until it could be fixed, they rented it out to me anyway. I found out the problem when I got there. And then when I asked for it to be fixed they said they didn't know the situation and there was no one around to fix it.

It was very easy to find the bedding for the couch and we were settled in within just a few minutes of arriving. Beds were comfortable and we slept great! We easily found all necessities. The amazon echo is a great added touch and having it already connected to a Spotify account meant that we could easily have music playing, which just added to the already great vibe of Paul's place. We only had a few days in Austin and hadn't originally planned for much time to just hang out at the airbnb, but it was such an inviting and great space, that we ended up rearranging some plans so that we could have more time to just enjoy the space & relax. Paul is helpful and responsive to all messages and provides a well thought out guide to the area. We loved picking up coffee & baked goods at Palomino Coffee each morning, just a couple minutes away from the Airbnb.

The record player was a great bonus (and because so, we ended up supporting many of the great record shops in town.) It was the best stay we've had in Austin.\nI would caution those who might be sensitive sleepers to be aware that on some nights the planes from the airport fly are routed to fly over the unit, making some nights noisy.

Bed, linens, and other amenities are very on point and make it feel very high end.\nHad a small issue that wasn't anything Daniel could have controlled before it happened and his responsiveness and helpfulness was so incredible and above and beyond! It's oftentimes not the issue that matters, it's how the host responds, which was so great! He even gave me a gift card as an apology, despite it not being something that he could have predicted or done anything about ahead of time.\nWill 100% look to stay here again when I'm back in Austin!

As for the location - it's just around the corner from Rainey Street, so very easy to walk to many different bars and restaurants. The host, Jason, was also fantastic. Proactive, responsive, and really went out of his way to ensure we were having a good experience.

Definitely recommend for a romantic getaway.', 'Great location - beautiful building', 'Jasons Condo is beautiful on the inside and has an amazing view. Few tips for future guests the rooms can get a little warm and there are no fans so I would recommend a fan if you sleep hot. Also girls bring an extra light to do your makeup the bathroom light is very dim. We stayed for 7 days and had an amazing time there is so much to do within walking distance. Everyone at the front desk in the lobby are friendly and helpful as well. If we come back to Austin in the future we will definitely stay here again.', 'Jason’s listing at the Nattivo was everything my group and I expected and more. The location of the property puts you in walking distance of the heart of Austin without having to overhear all the noise that comes with downtown Austin. The property had everything we needed and you can never leave your room and have a great time if you so choose. We will definitely be coming back and Jason’s property will be the ONLY place I will be staying at from now on!', 'Great spot to escape Hurricane Beryl. Plenty of street parking.

We had to leave early unfortunately but the place was lovely and spacious but also cozy. Would definitely recommend and would love to stay again if I return to Austin!', 'Stay in Style on Rainey Street was exactly as described. Located in a mixed residential and vacation rental building, there was a coffee shop and bar in the lobby so you can get a beverage when you need one. The suite was clean and modern with comfortable furniture and beds. Our favorite part was the location being a 5 minute walk to Raniey Street, which had the best bars, lounges and great food options for those not wanting the loud, college party scene of 6th Street. What really made this a 5-star experience was Jason’s response when we had a minor issue that we brought to his attention. Even on the super busy weekend 1 of Austin City Limits, his team was able to come and resolve it almost immediately, which really impressed us. We would definitely recommend Austin Roost as hosts for your next stay.', ""We stayed at Jason's place for a business/personal trip and it was perfect. The location was ideal for anyone visiting the Austin area. We walked to Rainey St and 6th St often to enjoy the downtown nightlife while in town. Very Nice. I would stay again and recommend others to do the same."", 'This apartment is beautiful!! Usually photos are nicer but this was the opposite for us the pictures don’t do the property justice.

Jason our host was very friendly and gave us clear instructions about everything. Very enjoyable environment for our trip to Austin!', 'Beautiful building, gym was nice just full of people. The pool was also full when we went around 10 at night. There was a lot of people drinking and smoking. The pool was not the cleanest. I would suggest not chose the property if your traveling with a family. I also recommend adding more lights to the rooms. Non of my lamps work so I was having to use bathroom light and living room light.', 'Jason’s listing surpassed our expectations !\nJason as a host responded in a timely manner, very considerate and helpful.\nI highly recommend and will be using this listing every time I travel to Austin.\nThank you Jason!', 'The apartment itself and rooftop pool are very nice. However, some amenities advertised were not working. I had to spend a day to get things functioning properly while on vacation (balcony door, TV, wall outlet).\nI also felt very unsafe in this area. I understand homeless people are in every major city. But there was a homeless person lingering inside the premises for two days. Each time I walked downstairs they would say verbally harass my family and me with racial slurs. The staff did not want to seem to intervene.', ""Now I understand and get all the positive reviews!!! Simply Spectacular all the way around!!\nOn a 16th floor high rise with a plus of being a corner unit to take in an awesomes view of downtown Austin!!...adding a nice sized balcony to lounge and take in the surrounding city views!\nA modern corner unit with 15' tall ceiling heights boasting floor to ceiling windows in the living room & bedrooms! \nThe immaculate & spacious condo was well appointed & fashionably decorated with a fully  equipped kitchen.\nCondo looks even better than the posted photos.

Really getting your moneys worth when staying. There’s also valet parking!! Austin is so busy so you hardly ever find parking. The valet was very convenient!

This is our second time staying in one of Jason's places in this building"", ""My coworker and I stayed here while in town for SXSW since we had to work a few different events on Rainey St. The location was incredibly convenient, had absolutely beautiful views of the Colorado River and the Downtown skyline, and don't even get me started about the rooftop pool up on the 33rd floor! I really appreciated how even though check-out was at 11am and I didn't fly out until the evening, the building front desk staff still allowed me to check my luggage so I wouldn't have to lug it around the city with me all day. You don't usually get that with most Airbnbs! If it's available the next time I'm in Austin, I would absolutely stay here again!"", ""We had amazing stay at Jason's place. Easy check in and out, luxury apartment with amazing views and rooftop pool. Highly recommended to anyone. Will return!"", 'Fantastic AirBnB! I live in Austin and was hosting some friends from out of town. My selection had the desired effect…I was flooded with text from my guests who said it was absolutely gorgeous with stunning views of the city, lady bird lake, and beautiful decor throughout.

Will be staying there again!', 'Beautiful and spacious apartment with fantastic amenities. Enjoyed walking to many restaurants, cafes, etc nearby. Bonus to have a cafe and bar downstairs as well.\nThe apartment is managed by a property management group, so there are very strict checkin/out times (or fees apply without any opportunity to request extensions of any kind), and when I extended the trip stay, they declined and would only accept the extension if I payed more than what airbnb quoted for the change. Thought that was a little unusual, but regardless of that, we loved the stay.', ""This stay exceeded my expectations. Great location and views from the unit. Beds were comfortable and everything was very clean. The amenities were good too but I would caution that the pool is not heated so during colder months it's not really usable unless you intend to use it for cold plunges.

The apartment looked just like the pictures. Furniture was comfortable and well decorated. The window cleaners did happen to be out there on Wednesday morning around 8 or 9 am and the noise scared me half to death. It would have been nice to maybe know the schedule, thankfully my blinds were down and they couldn’t see in. As someone who is not used to having window cleaners this was alarming to me, because it was unexpected. I would also be mindful to leave time for Valet to retrieve your car. They said they were quick, but at times no one was around and it took quite a while. But the convenience was nice. Other than that bathrooms were fully stocked and we enjoyed the place.']",['8 guests · 2 bedrooms · 4 beds · 2 baths'],https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/611009661090145040?adults=1&children=0&enable_m3_private_room=true&infants=0&pets=0&search_mode=regular_search&check_in=2024-12-08&check_out=2024-12-13&source_impression_id=p3_1729616487_P3_-d4m8JsaYfwfU&previous_page_section_name=1000&federated_search_id=20ccc806-ff86-4daa-80a6-c96153d1edc5

She provided new pots that we needed to cook and even purchase a blanket for us, and provided and extra AC unit.

There was a lot to do nearby between spas, shopping, food and drinks.\nThe bad:\nThere's no personal touch or investment into the apartment. It's really a 1 bed/2 bath with an office that's been converted into an additional bedroom. The 2nd bedroom is small with no closet and the bed slept super hot with a lot of motion transfer. The frosted covering on the glass door was peeling and inadequate at keeping the light out. We literally put blankets over the door to stop the light coming in and that was better than the other room that didn't have curtains over the window. Both tubs were dirty and there was no water pressure. The apartment definitely wasn't taken care of between the frosted glass, LED strip(which didn't work), and wallpaper all peeling.

Things to improve is the bathroom door as it does not close completely, the shower door opens alone when they are bathing. When you go into the balcony there is a lot of dirt and it's not clean.

It was also nice being able to walk by the chicken coop across the alley each morning. There's even a bunny in there!\nThe place was clean where it mattered the most, but was missing on the details. When sitting on the couch, you could see dust and some crumbs on the kitchenette counter from a previous guest. Bathroom walls also needed some attention, as there were some dead bugs, likely smashed dead by previous guests.\nThere are indeed some yippy dogs next door who I assume the host has no control over.

Bed was ok, it was a little firm for my liking.\nThe only nit-picky thing I can say is that the bathroom sink is very small and it made it hard to wash my face without water going everywhere.\nOverall though, I loved the aesthetic and privacy and all the nice details they put into the place.', 'This Airbnb was lovely, I loved the way it was decorated and the location was perfect since it was a 3min drive from the wedding venue I was going to for the weekend. The personal note and Topo Chico was a lovely touch that made our welcome very sweet.\nI will say that the only thing that felt like a big bummer was when we realized the patio/outside area didn’t match the photos. There was no comfy outdoor furniture or rug like depicted in the photos, there were just a couple black-wire chairs with no cushions , which was so disappointing since it was the main reason we booked this place- we really wanted a wine night in with friends from out of town.\nOther than that, it was a nice place to stay.', 'The studio was a perfect for a weekend getaway.

The free street parking is also convenient if you are renting a car! I would definitely recommend Amanda’s place to anyone wanting to explore Austin.', ""My first interaction with the host was her asking me if I would be checking in later to give her extra time for the cleaning staff. I thought that was weird - I paid the expensive cost for staying in Austin so I don't want to deal with hosts who are unprepared. If your cleaning lady is late, pick up a mop!\nThe interior design and accommodations were adequate but unimaginative. Pretty much what you expect from Air BnB these days. This place won't blow you away but for the price its fair. The space theme is amusing but the portrait of Elon Musk on the wall is in bad taste.\nI also got confused by the description for how to access the home. It appears there are two door codes listed and I thought I was locked out for awhile.\nTo improve I suggest the host stock nicer body wash and better coffee and add more attention and taste to the furniture and decor.\nThis listing is acceptable for the price in Austin which is expensive relative to other areas.

Brandon was extra communicative about anything I needed, and was a great host in general!', 'Very good located. 5min walk to south Congress. The apartment was well equipped and nice. The only downside was that the bed was a little small for 2 people (and my wife and I are only 5\'5"")', 'On the positive side, Amanda was responsive and friendly. The place was easy to find with parking onsite. Once inside, it was clean and quaint. The TV had streaming, some coffees and teas were given, and the location is close to South Congress and First St.\nHowever, there are a few things to consider when staying here. First, there is only one barstool, which was wobbly. The couch is incredibly small and uncomfortable. The bedroom pillows and comforter were very cheap- you could feel that the artificial filling had separated. In the bathroom, we had super thin toilet paper you could see through. The gate to the community could be heard through the window, especially in the living room. The plug under the desk did not work, and two of the three lights in the fan fixture in the bedroom were out.\nIn all, this property provided one of the more convenient budget options in Austin, but the amenities need an update and some basic attention to make this feel it is worth the money.', ""Amanda is a great host and she is very responsive. Her place is very clean.\nDuring my stay of 6 days, there was an internet outage for 2 days because of storm. Obviously, no host can fix these kinds of problems generated due to nature's issues but Amanda was very prompt in communication and was very helpful throughout !

The place was so relaxing that I literally feel like with the waking hours I was actually there I was outside enjoying the outdoor seating and listening to the night sounds.\nAs mentioned in the listing the stairs are steep but I had no issues and there are hand rails to help you until you get the feel. Upstairs I had no issues with headroom but anything more than 6\' 3"" and you\'ll find yourself having to tilt your head when taking a shower; again though it wasn\'t an issue for me.\nThe AC upstairs will definitely cool the room quickly and the bed is very comfortable as was the couch. The hardwoods upstairs and down definitely make the space feel bigger.\nDefinitely a great stay and definitely hope the next time I\'m in the Austin area that Kris and LJ\'s place is available.', 'Kris & LJ are excellent hosts!

The location gives easy access to everything in Austin. The place was super clean, modern and beautifully decorated with a ton of natural light. It has quite a bit of stairs so if you have mobility issues this is not the place for you. It has everything you need, a stove, microwave, small fridge w/ a tiny freezer and a toaster oven. Blankets, towels, body wash, shampoo, conditioner. Hair dryer, iron. They left a few items for us in the fridge like blueberries and some water and drinks which was a nice touch. The big bed was comfy the day bed was very firm but actually perfect for me due to back issues. Owners were super quick to answer all questions and concerns. Very nice and courteous. Only 2 negatives to this place.. it was fairly warm(middle of summer 98+ outside ) in the room when we returned in the evening from our outings..it never went below 77 until the middle of the night w/ a fan (provided) on all night. The other negative was we had to park on the street and walk down the ally to the apartment. It is a very short walk but not knowing the neighborhood I didn’t feel comfortable leaving my car on the street. It was fine in the end but I would prefer to have my car next to the apartment.

It was a quick Uber ride from downtown where we enjoyed the hosts recommendations!', ""Very comfortable, quiet place to serve as my launching point for exploring East Austin. I lived in ATX for many years so it was nice to return as a visitor and pinpoint my home base. No rental car needed here, a walk or a short uber/lyft is more than adequate for just about anywhere you can think of in the East/Downtown ATX areas. My favorite feature was the awesome Klipsch bluetooth speaker which I used constantly. Its big sound fills the cavernous space nicely. Communication with hosts was instantaneous when needed, which I always appreciate. I wish I would've had an opportunity to meet them while I was there (actually it was their dogs I really wanted to meet but it would've also been fun to meet my hosts). I will definitely book again when I return! Thank you Carter and Juli!"", 'Great place, great hosts, great time. Thank you!', 'The place was great!

Our trip was booked last minute and the rate couldn't have been more affordable for the time of year. Prior to our visit, Juli & Carter shared detailed instructions on the location and check-in process. Arriving on a late flight, we were super appreciative to get to the studio after dark with easy access in a safe neighborhood. Our hosts provided an extensive list of recommendations for both activities and eating out which we loved! All in all, the space was welcoming and so cozy!! We enjoyed making breakfast each morning in the kitchen together, and were grateful for the closet and full size dresser that allowed us to unpack and feel at home for a few days.

The Airbnb itself is beautiful--well-lit and well-decorated with thoughtful little touches like a speaker, a space heater, a record player, and a little booklet with local recommendations.

They had great recommendations, always responded quickly, and gave us really clear check-in instructions. They went out of their way to help us with the thermostat when we had some trouble with it, and they even restocked some of the pantry items while we were there.\nLocation was awesome. There's so much within a quick drive (including downtown), and East Austin is a fun neighborhood to explore. I would note that the neighborhood is still up-and-coming, so I probably wouldn't do evening walks alone if you're staying here, especially in certain pockets. But we always felt safe and didn't feel uncomfortable parking our car by the Airbnb or anything like that.\nGreat Airbnb, great hosts. Would absolutely stay here again!"", 'This place is so comfy and cute! Very sunny and thoughtfully arranged layout! Be aware that for first-time visitors to Austin (like myself), this area is a juxtaposition of gentrification and ""up and coming."" I personally didn\'t mind, but walking around, it\'s just something to be aware of. Also, I am very accustomed to using public transportation, and during my week here, the buses weren\'t the most reliable so I had to mostly Lyft/Uber. The studio itself was fantastic! In unit laundry, plenty of towels and mountains of pillows! Only minor issues were there being no bathroom soap, but I just used the kitchen soap so it wasn\'t a big deal.

Loved this place!', 'Great stay', 'Nice play to stay in Austin that had everything we needed! Bed was comfortable and wifi was great for remote work. The only thing we would have liked to have was a better location. You really need to have a car if you’re staying here because there’s nothing going on in the area in terms of restaurants or cafes.

That alone was reason enough for us to give them a good review, but they went above and beyond for our visit: they tinted the windows, placed plenty of cold water in the fridge, and even left extra fans for us to use.

The AC blows cold and the home stays cold, which is important coming in from the Texas summer heat. It's located in Central East Austin so it was easy to get everywhere! If you're needing to use public transportation there is a bus stop a block over, off the alley. Something to be mindful of: This is an above the garage unit, while the listing does mention it, you will need to go up a flight of stairs to access the home. If it's two of you, carrying your luggage up/down won't be too bad, but if you're traveling alone with heavier luggage you may need to consider having to haul your luggage by yourself.

The complex had little to no directions - it's like a labyrinth - and while the apartment is impeccably clean, the corridors of all buildings are pretty dirty and in need for a major face lift.

Andrei has thought of everything you might need (mini-fridge, microwave, service for coffee/tea, white noise machine) and was incredibly responsive and helpful.

First, the apartment was extremely heavily fragranced with 5 different perfumed oil diffusers, which caused our eyes to sting and smelled overpowering. We located and moved those outside, opened all the windows, and wore masks for several hours until the smell got less severe. The linens and towels were also heavily scented.

It is within walking distance (less than 10 min) to highly-rated restaurants and to the town lake. You can easily jog/walk down towards the South Lamar bridge (beautiful) or at the lake. You are also very close to Whole Foods if you need to get last minute food items.\nOverall, the stay was very comfy. The bedsheets were the softest I’ve even slept in. The only downside I do have to mention is that there is a lot of light that comes into the bedroom. So, maybe, an eye cover would be helpful to sleep. Also, the aircon machine is a bit loud if you want to keep it on for the night, which, in a summer day, you kind of have to.\nOther than that, I would definitely recommend Brett’s place.

The kitchen had what we needed to make a few meals and keep beverages cold.\nThe AC worked great during some very warm weather. The hot water worked great too (two people in the apt.). The lights flickered quite a bit, but I was guessing that was due to the power grid being stressed from everyone using AC?\nBrett's manual with all the information about the apt. was one of the best I've seen.

Air conditioning makes annoying noise when turning on and off The living room fan too. There are plenty of dishes and cooking utensils. There was also no salt or oil. Old and dirty looking bathroom.

The yard was great for the dogs and we really liked that there was a crib for our daughter.

We wanted to make sure there was actually a crib or pack and play because we have past experience of a listing stating there was a crib when there wasn’t. There was also no crib visible in any photos. We asked him to confirm a crib or pack and play twice on the app, once by text, and once by phone call (he provided his phone number). We didn’t receive a response at all, just automated check in/check out messages. We brought our pack and play to be safe and there did turn out to be a crib.

The place was clean, comfortable, and easy to find. Parking directly in front of the unit was a huge plus. The amenities were perfect. The temperature was easily regulated. The hosts were very responsive. I will definitely be returning soon.', 'Better than a ""great deal."" Cheaper than all hotels and more comfortable than most.\nIt\'s on the edge of campus and walking distance to downtown, Lamar Street, the Capitol, and the river (longish walks, but nice). Exceptionally clean and comfortable.\nThis is not a suite or an apartment most adults would want to live in permanently. It\'s a well furnished studio with an updated bathroom and kitchen- perfect for one or two people for a few days in Austin.\nNick was also super responsive to the two questions I had. When/if I come back to Austin, this place will be on my short list of places to stay.', 'LOVED staying here!! It was conveniently close to campus and other places that we needed to be. Parking was excellent, clean unit, great communication with host. Definitely would come stay here again when I’m in Austin!!', 'Great place to stay, very close to everything and many restaurants in the area', 'Great location if you’re visiting UT — right on west campus and very walkable. Host was quick to respond to any questions and was very helpful.', 'The apartment itself is very clean and the location is great. Very close to many interesting locations in Austin tx and very peaceful at night. The bed is really comfortable and the free parking is great. We had everything we needed for the most part although there are a few things that I found to be an annoyance and maybe even a safety concern. Firstly, there’s no microwave. That was incredibly annoying as most cheaper hotels tend to include at least a small microwave. Second, the ac unit used in the apartment was incredibly weak. It would take hours for the apartment to get anywhere near being cold. It was quite warm throughout my stay and sleeping was a bit uncomfortable due to that. The little ac unit just couldn’t get the job done as much as it tried. Third, the gas stove was placed right next to the gas water heater. That’s definitely a safety hazard as no flammable object or anything of the sort should be placed next to a gas water heater let alone a whole stove. Using the stove just wasn’t an option due to the safety concerns and not having a microwave made staying there a tad bit annoying. Lastly, there was little to no privacy which was a huge disappointment. The large windows in the front had no curtains so anyone walking by could look right in. I don’t think adding curtains would be too much trouble because they are definitely needed as privacy is very important. Other than that, as mentioned above the location was great and pretty peaceful. My stay was not bad by any means just could’ve been better for the price might look into safer and more comfortable options in the future though.', 'Close to campus, very much as seen and described!', 'Great location', 'No complaints, everything was as advertised.', 'Small but comfortable studio with all the basic necessities provided.

Highly recommended for y’all', ""Andrea's studio was super charming and exactly what we needed for our long weekend in Austin! Super clean and well stocked with essentials. The studio is on the corner of the building, so you do get sound from all angles, and there was quite a bit of noise at night from being surrounded by college housing. There was also super loud construction in another unit of the complex one morning (not our host's fault of course!

Easy access!', ""If you like firm, supportive memory foam beds, this one is 11/10. The best we've ever had at an Airbnb or hotel! Personally, we like to sleep with darker conditions than this place can provide. Know that light does come through the windows above the bed in the mornings and there is a bright porch light outside the front door that you cannot turn off. It definitely kept us up. The shower pressure was good, however, the water will never get hot - lukewarm at best. Not a huge deal breaker, but be advised if that's problematic for you!\nLocated in a very walkable area - lots of fun food trucks and eateries to discover nearby!

The upstairs gets hot even though we had the thermostat set at 70. (note, we went in the summer.) If you close the bedroom doors, like we did, it didn't feel like the A/C was getting into the rooms.

Ride shares were cheap and quick to get us around in the evening. The home itself was cozy & exactly as pictured! Not to mention we are picky sleepers and slept really well in the king bed.\nPS: This Airbnb is best suited for 4 people rather than 6 as listed, as anyone not sleeping in the upstairs bedrooms will likely be downstairs where there are no shades/blinds for the windows, and the sofa is not a pull-out.

Would definitely stay again when we come back!', 'Cute Airbnb in a great location! Although it’s very close to the main house it felt very private.

Paul was welcoming and I felt at home with my privacy and kitchen to get up and go each morning. I definitely plan on coming back soon.', 'Easy check in/out. Beautiful guest home! I really enjoyed my stay!', ""This location is especially good for short stays. The guest house is one large room (plus bathroom with tub/shower), so guests who expect to fold down the sofa for an extra bed should be friendly with one another. Equipped with a fridge and a small range, but better for people who expect to eat most of their meals out. And there are many good choices within a mile's walk through the neighborhood. I would recommend this spot especially for those who have business downtown, UT or anywhere in north central Austin. I called Lyfts for business at the convention center. They arrived quickly and fares were less than $10."", 'This is the absolute perfect place to stay if you want to be close to everything.

What's more: Cherrywood Coffeehouse down the road was the cherry on top of the cake :)"", 'Paul’s place was located in an amazing spot to get to and from UT Austin.

The shower situation is not *great* (low water pressure, takes a while for water to heat up, awkward shower set up) but not bad enough to not book a short stay! Great location, easy to get in, I never had to contact the host for anything.', ""Jake's place was really cool with a lot of character and personal touches which we liked a lot - it was very comfortable for us as a couple and the place felt like home, very clean and with everything we needed. It was excellently located for the great bars on East 6th Street, and its proximity to Franklin's made it easy to queue early (although there's lots of great food options in the area without a 2+ hour wait)! Would definitely recommend to people staying in Austin :)"", 'Very responsive hosts! The place itself is very cottage-like. Cozy and charming.', ""Location that's hard to beat if you're visiting to eat BBQ and all the good food in East Austin. Very short drive to downtown as well. Cute tiny home, clean and quiet, with a nice back yard and good selection of records to play."", 'Great location (close to Downtown Austin) and very quiet place, super clean, cool decoration, renovated bathroom and a cozy outdoor patio. The host left snacks and treats in the fridge. But I recommend it more if you are on a trip that you are not spending most of the time at home.', 'Had such a great experience spending time in Austin and Jake’s place really put it over the top! The space is so cute decorated in such a fun and unique way. It is peaceful and private with it being fully enclosed by fence. We also loved how close by it is to downtown Austin including 6th street and Congress! Definitely worth the stay if you can!', 'It was a great spot and walkable to brunch in the morning. A quick cab ride or drive into the middle of the city can get you to any sights or nightlife that you’d want to see.', 'If you’re debating where to stay, definitely pick Jake’s place! Walkable to a lot of great places. The space is so comfortable and stocked with amenities. Beautiful space outside to soak up the sun. Cannot recommend enough! If I need a place to stay next time I’m in Austin, I would absolutely rebook!', 'great place for what we needed it to be! absolutely no issues at all. Would definitely recommend to somebody needing a place downtown for a couple of nights!', 'This spot is in a nice and quiet spot that is also very close to restaurants, bars, and more. Inside is very cosy and was exactly what I was looking for during my stay in Austin. 10/10 would recommend and stay again.', 'Very clean & cozy. Great place for a romantic couple’s trip!', 'Beautiful, classically Austin-quirky space in a great neighborhood. Very comfortable for a two-night stay; the kitchen might be a little minimal (air fryer, but no stove or microwave) for a longer stretch. The loft bedroom is a bit cramped, but it’s a cool little space, and the bed was quite comfortable.', 'Jake was very responsive and the place was as described. It was particularly humid and hot the weekend I was there so tough for me to walk around but there are a couple of cute bars and coffee store around the corner that I got the best coffee from in the morning!', 'Loved this cute little abode. So cozy, creative, and had everything we needed!', 'Great place!! Super cozy and right in the middle of everything on the east side. Will come back anytime!!', 'Great, cozy place for a quick trip to Austin!', 'Great Stay!', 'the cutest stay! it as in a great area too !', 'This guest house was beautifully decorated with a trendy hipster vibe. I especially loved the restored record player and the collection of records perfect for a jam session. The bathroom was exceptionally well-stocked with all the necessities and more. The kitchenette, though small, was ideal for preparing light meals before heading out. The private yard was a great feature, allowing the dogs to roam freely. Conveniently located in the heart of all the restaurants and bars (a car is recommended), the neighborhood felt safe and quiet for walking the dogs both morning and night. I highly recommend staying here—10/10. Additionally, the three different A/C units kept the place comfortable during the scorching Texas heat.', 'It was exactly what we needed.\nA perfect space with all the necessities for a city getaway.\nThe air con was super! Especially in the really REALLY hot Summer and we looked forward to coming back to the Airbnb to cool down often ☺️.\nThe Austin magazines were very helpful too and much appreciated.', 'We loved staying here! It was in a tucked away alley so it was quiet and felt safe but was a 5-10 minute walk to a lot of great places to eat! Highly recommend!', 'Overall good stay. Clean, conveniently located in the East. Location is awesome in the sense that you can’t get to all the touristy stuff via scooter or drive to wherever else within 15-20 mins. Parking is easy. I wouldn’t say that the hosts are friendly, but they’re also not rude. Communication is minimal and response time may be the next day. The AC has to be fully cranked to get the bedroom area/ loft cool enough to sleep - we learned that the hard way the first night. We didn’t have wifi after the first day, but I let them know I had a mifi and I didn’t get a response nor was it fixed. Very dog friendly space - fenced in area is awesome! Warning that the mosquitoes are quite vicious, but the hosts can’t help that.', 'Great location! Everything you need for a romantic getaway.

The space was just what we needed and had everything to ensure a comfortable stay. Within walking distance to shops and Franklin's BBQ, not far from a food truck park and a short uber ride away from everything we could need from Austin. The handbook for things to do provided us with Barton Springs, where we spent hours and hours - exactly what we needed, and we didn't even know it.

Good value for what you pay for- comfy bed, clean sheets, good A/C, convenient location for the convention center. But I would not stay here again. Take with a grain of salt- it could be a great stay for someone else with different expectations and background.\nMajor complaints: inadequate cleaning, was not messy but the place didn’t meet my needs (asthma) and standards\nThe entrance is very small tucked away in the very back and was not lit at night every night of my stay, and a truck parked directly in front of it. This created a sketchy experience as I could not clearly see my path. As a woman I did not feel safe here alone.\nDetails: extremely dusty (couch, table surfaces, top of toilet, shower shelf, etc.), random things that let you know the home was only lightly or very quickly cleaned - a Bobby pin left on the rug, a giant wad of hair stuck on the side of the shower wall, a dead water bug in the kitchen sink', 'We had a great time thanks for the hospitality', 'Awesome place!

We booked for one night but wished we had stayed longer. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a convenient and cozy getaway!', 'I could not say enough kind words about this place! I felt like I was in a little artsy cabin in the woods but was actually so close to so much on the east side (most importantly my fave brunch spot Paperboy was a 2 min walk away).\nFrom all the art, the record player, the super comfy bed, to the grill and and adorable yard this place is a 10/10. The small details really made this stay feel so cozy. Def will come back to stay.', 'I enjoyed my stay here overall. Location is decent. Relatively ~clean. I loved that it felt private. Good amenities, as it had everything you needed. Like the other reviews, communication with hosts could be better, but it was still sufficient.', ""First of all, this was the most well-stocked place I've ever stayed - books, games, snacks, drinks, toiletries, towels, sheets, blankets, space heaters, umbrellas, and more! The sofa did not look like the one in the photos (as of Nov 2023), but it's actually larger. They have an air mattress for downstairs if needed, but the couch worked just fine for sleeping as well (in addition to one guest in the loft bed). The space is VERY private! It's basically a tiny house and supply shed, and even though it's part of the main house's property, it's surrounded by it's own 6-foot fence that can be locked from the outside and the inside, so it felt very safe. It was pretty clean except for some dust bunnies on the stairs. Yard could also use some TLC. Quick response when we needed some extra supplies. We spent most of our in Downtown Austin, a quick Uber ride away (or long-ish walk). Walkable to E. 6th St. bars & restaurants. No TV but WiFi is good. Would recommend."", 'Really cool spot in East Austin - nice quiet street and the weather was cool enough that we could walk to Downtown in the day.

Had everything we needed for the most part. Location is excellent.\nIt was incredibly dark outside when entering. Very difficult to enter the code into the gate lock.\nThe place was as described, except for a couple of things. We were told there would be towels and a blanket that we could take to Barton Springs, but the only towels were bath towels, and the only blankets were these fluffy blankets that would not be suitable to take anywhere except for the couch or the bed. Also, in the middle of August, the upstairs bedroom area gets unbearably hot. I kept wishing the unit was in the window upstairs. I would have slept on the couch however, the sheets that were supposed to be available were not. $70 cleaning fee is pretty steep, considering how mediocre it was cleaned. The milk in the fridge that was provided for the cereal had expired two months prior. The magazines for Austin area were from 2017-2023. Attention to detail is key to a 5*, this wasn’t it.', 'This was a great area of the city to stay in and explore. Nice proximity to several places I wanted to visit.', 'Great little spot! Perfect for a touchdown space for those looking to explore the city! Was able to easily walk to the busier area of 6th street, bus stops to get downtown are very close too (Austin public transit was a breeze with the app). About a fifteen minute walk to Target and tons of bars and restaurants. Walk felt safe even at night. The entrance is tucked away in an alley which was nice to be off the main road. Definitely recommend to someone traveling solo, or with another!', ""This is definitely one of the best places we've stayed. Was a perfect location in a quite neighborhood but still very close to great bars and restaurants. We even walked to downtown during our stay."", ""Awesome location!! The cottage has a very groovy Austin vibe.\nI would love to stay here again, but not during a heat wave.

There was local coffee left out as well as various toiletries to make guests' stay more enjoyable. I quite enjoyed the their record collection as well. It's in a great location and super walkable.

Shower curtains could have been a bit cleaner and no overhead lights, so the unit remains fairly dark at nighttime even with use of lamps. Unit remained fairly warm despite air conditioning being on. A window in the kitchen area was unlocked when we arrived and curtains in the kitchen area would have afforded a greater sense of privacy.', 'Charming back house, convenient location.', 'Great place to stay in Austin.

I decided on AirBnB because most of the hotels close to campus couldn't accommodate both of us at a reasonable price. This property was better than perfect for my daughter and me: two bedrooms with King beds. Usually, one of us gets stuck on a lumpy sleep sofa. A nicely appointed kitchen and plenty of space in the family room were perfect for unwinding after each day's events. It's not within walking distance to campus, but pretty much a 7-minute drive to anywhere is pretty convenient. Off-street, private parking is also a nice feature of this property. I'll look forward to my next visit to UT and this place will be on the top of my list!"", 'Can it get any cozier? So close to downtown but nestled away in a cottage. Loved it!', 'Cute house in a nice area. Host was extremely communicative. Kitchen was nice, but very sparsely stocked. King beds are always a plus, but the sheets didn’t fit properly and came off as soon as you sat on the bed.

It had a very strong old house smell - understand this is not something to be easily fixed. However, important to note for guests especially of they are sensitive. Kitchen cabinets are pretty much empty, except for a coffee filter and k-cup coffees. Small items like creamer, sugar, tea bags go long way. The washer and dryer are outside the house which is not a big problem but somewhat inconvenient. The parking was easy, you literally park in front of the front door which makes getting in and out very easy.', 'My family of four stayed at the immaculate Austin Vacay house for 12 days and absolutely loved everything about our experience. It was the perfect location in a beautiful neighborhood near almost every main Austin attraction. It was roomy and very clean — which made our stay enjoyable and stress free.

I lived here for a month and managed to cook most of my meals. In short: great hosts, great deal.', 'Nice, clean stay in a sort of retro home in a great location/neighborhood. Quick and helpful communication, great local suggestions including travel from AUS. One hot plate and some pans, a microwave and toaster oven & of course the gas grill. Nice private patio, even saw a fox walk across the back yard! Comfy bed.

It has a very serene feeling, and with surfaces that can be used as worktops in both rooms, it's a good place for remote work, writing, and peaceful reflection. The neighborhood is super-quiet and calm, while also being relatively close to some of the hustle and bustle, and very close to the magic that is Barton Springs. I was here in very hot weather and loved having control over the temperature (a/c was lovely and needed, and at the same time I tend to get cold at the a/c levels a lot of people set in the summer, so it was nice to not have it stronger than my comfort level). The bed is super-comfortable. Big closet in the bedroom is useful if you're on a bigger trip and have a lot of stuff you want to store. A cleanliness issue upon my arrival (which I imagine was a fluke) was swiftly resolved. I had the chance to have great conversations with Michael and Luz, and appreciated a couple instances where they had good tips about specific places. I would have happily stayed longer and would definitely book this place again!"", ""The accommodations were just as shown, except for the patio area which is nicer than depicted. The neighborhood is quiet and as a solo traveler, I never felt unsafe.

4.88",364,Superhost,9 years hosting,,"[""We stayed with Amina for 3 nights leading up to the big eclipse. Her property is beautiful and well-landscaped. Amina provided a guidebook of Austin. We enjoyed the proximity Lady Bird Lake and within a few blocks you'll find fabulous restaurants. Amina was friendly and communicative. A few reviewers have pointed out this is a shared space, the host lives in the building, and other renters are nearby. That was no problem, but we did wake up early one morning to loud noises in the shared hallway. It was unfortunate timing, but Amina let us know on the day of our arrival that she would need to bring in an outside contractor to perform a fumigation and we'd need to be out of the house for at least 6+ hours. Not a toxic fumigation, and we understood the reasons for it, but it left us with physical symptoms and a lingering smell on our clothes. Amina gave us the option to cancel, but being eclipse weekend, that would be difficult and expensive. She did offer a discount to compensate us."", 'Great spot in a cozy area of Austin. close to the river and the space is amazing. super spacious and very home-like. my only regret was not staying here my whole trip to Austin! planning a trip back and definitely planning my stay here.', 'Awesome spot in Austin.

She was so quick to answer all of our questions and to resolve a couple of small issues during our stay (such as the power temporarily going out). I was very pleased with how clean the unit was, including the squeaky clean bathroom. Two quirks worth mentioning - first, the driveway is fairly steep (it took us a while to navigate it without scratching the bottom of our sedan) but luckily street parking out front is also always an option. Second, the bedroom door and one of the bathroom doors are sliding barn doors, and they neither lock nor sit entirely flush with the wall when closed (thus leaving a small gap). Not a big deal but just be aware in case you are traveling with others. Overall, we had a wonderful time as the unit is very cute, and the neighborhood is lovely and also close to various trails.

The master bed was super comfy, other bed was a great size for a kid. Good restaurants in the area, nice hiking trailhead right around the corner.

I guess it's pretty much the same in all big cities across the US these days. Anyway the place was safe and parking was right in front of the unit.

That is OK with me, but Blake decided to violate his own quiet hours and hosted a hot tub gathering starting just before 11 PM.\nHearing six or seven folks yakking about the latest gossip after quiet hours wasn't what I paid for. Earplugs didn't help. I spent the next hour pacing the floor waiting for it to get quiet again so I could go back to sleep.

Would definitely stay again!', 'great location!', 'Juno’s place was everything it advertised and then some. The apartment was very clean with everything you need for a worry free stay. The near by lake is simply beautiful and easily accessible. Proximity to downtown made it easy to enjoy the many bars and restaurants, even by foot, while enjoying the lake. Juno was such a great host. Very attentive and in communication with us trough out our stay. I wouldn’t think twice about staying there in the future. It was a very enjoyable experience.', 'Spacious and cozy space in walking distance to beautiful path along the river.

Also walkable to a couple of food trucks, restaurants, Walgreens, and our fave was the Buzz Mill…highly recommend the honey badger coffee!!', 'Awesome space and spot! Walking trails, direct access to paddle board. Super close to Emo’s if you are catching a show there. Had a great time. Super comfortable and loaded space.', 'Great stay!

Everything was on the up n up and clean. Has a private back yard area right on the south shore trail, pool right outside the patio door. Coffee and breakfast sammies are a 3 min walk. Restaurants and other amenities 5-10 min walk. Nice place to post up for an Austin vacay!', 'Amazing place. I relaxed at the pool and wifi reached out there as well so could work outdoors as well. Got to walk the trails every day with breakfast tacos at one of the food trucks next door.. didn’t even need a car. The apartment is also spotless and very comfortable.

We had a few issues (water being turned off, fire alarm malfunctioning, unable to access laundry without code that wasn't provided). Host was communicative."", 'My husband and I chose Juno’s place for a trip to Austin. We were looking for a place relatively close to downtown, walkable with things to do and places to eat nearby, and this ended up being a perfect spot. We loved being so close to the trail for Ladybird Lake and walked this a couple days. There is a food truck park with a coffee truck right next door to the complex which was super yummy and convenient. There were restaurants close by that we walked to and the food was delicious. The area felt very safe, anyone we ran into was friendly. The condo was easy to find and check in was a breeze. The condo was very clean, spacious for the two of us, and comfortable. Having the pool was a nice perk and that area was clean and quiet during our stay. We got a quick Uber downtown one night which didn’t take long at all and wasn’t too expensive. Would absolutely stay here again on a future trip to Austin!', 'Very clean and had all the amenities. We enjoyed our stay, especially the Starbucks across the street.', 'Loved this little gem! The living space is larger than the images portray. Loved the daybed/couch! We ran into a few residents in passing and they were so nice and welcoming. You literally have the pool in your backyard. We loved the pool accessories provided by the host. Best part is, the park and the river can be found STEPS away from exiting the complex. It does not feel congested in the area due to the park. Plenty of scooters around and water boards and kayaks to rent. Be sure to check out the hosts suggested places to visit (sent via link and a booklet in the unit). We followed them and loved (especially Sawyers)! Home was clean and had a cozy feel!', 'The space was very clean and comfortable. Perfect for my son and I visiting my other son who lives in the Amli South complex. The remote control for the living room fan was missing. Juno responded quickly and dropped off a portable fan. The bed in the living room was a full size mattress in a sofa like box frame. My 6 ft., 190 lb son was very comfortable!', 'Nice place. Easy access, very clean. Picture accurately portray the property. I would stay there again.', 'Great location, amenities, and stay!', 'Juno’s place surpassed my expectations. It’s in a prime location within steps of the beautiful Lady Bird Lake trail. Morning walks right behind the complex were a highlight of our trip. There’s also a food truck park right next to the complex with amazing coffee and breakfast options. Within a short walk there are lots of great restaurants too. We had a car, and never drove more than 10-15 minutes to all the attractions we wanted to visit and we easily got around by e-scooter too, with plenty of them available right outside the complex. Even the Wholefoods flagship store was a quick 10 min drive, which I loved! My only complaint is that the pool was closed most of the week for maintenance/cleaning, which was out of Juno’s control, but would have been nice to know ahead of time. The apartment itself was very clean and had everything we needed. It could use a few updates, but everything worked well and it was a great place to rest. I would come back any time!', 'Juno was extremely easy and frictionless to work with. Highly recommend', 'Juno’s place was a cute apartment with colorful decorations. The apartment is clean and comfortable. The complex is conveniently located by the lady bird trail and has some restaurants in walkable distance.\nThe only downside was that it took us a long time to find the unit (be sure to take the entrance on the side of the parking lot instead of the main one to access the apartment). Also the bathroom was in the bedroom so sth to note if you’re traveling with people who’d stay in the living room.\nOverall a fantastic stay!', 'Great location, very clean house.', 'Location was awesome, place was nice and clean, it needed some little details fixed but nothing that interrupted our stay, pool needed some maintenance.\nCommunication was great and overall we would still come back to this place we really enjoyed our stay.', 'This place was perfect! My friends and I came to Austin for a weekend to do some fun activities (tubing, touring the capital building) and it was conveniently located for everything. The space was clean and comfortable. And the pool was awesome for a little late morning swim. The hosts were super helpful and left a list of a ton of fun things to do and places to eat. I’d stay again if I ever go back to Austin.', ""We were happy with our stay! Great location for proximity to downtown, ability to walk to activities, and feeling safe. While a little beat up in terms of outlets, fixtures, etc, the home was comfortable. It provided a perfect launching point for our great trip and we ended up loving so many things about the city of Austin! Overall, we'd recommend this stay for the price!"", 'Absolutely perfect location in heart of Austin!! I loved the windows in living area with lots of natural light!! Very safe and friendly neighbors!', 'great place! will book again!', 'It was a really clean place in a great spot!', 'We stayed here for 5 nights while visiting our daughter. Juno was proactive which made our check in very smooth. The condo is conveniently located along the Lady Bird Trail with close proximity to Lady Bird Lake, Butler Metro Park, Zilker Park and the downtown area. The condo was clean, spacious and furnished with modern decor. The bed was comfortable with extra pillows and blankets available. The pool is located just outside the back patio doors. We enjoyed soaking in the late afternoon sun each day poolside. If weather permitted Juno had an abundant supply of towels! Next time we’re in Austin we would look forward to staying here again.', 'Great location next to the walking path. Be sure to visit the food truck Brunch, Brunch, Baby-which is right next to the place-a lovely couple with excellent sandwiches! Juno was great with communication and very responsive with what we needed. Our plane got delayed and she let us leave our bags there for a few hours and we really appreciated that. Everything we needed for the week!', 'Juno’s hit the three C’s.\nConvenient, comfortable, and clean.\nWould stay there again any time.', 'Juno was so nice and her communication was great. Her home was nice and close to good places to eat.', 'Look no more! Hard to decide with do many options in Austin. But this place is a gem because the beautiful apartments face the pool and also has direct access to the beautiful ladybird trail. It’s also fully equipped and covered parking space always available. Enjoy', 'There is a walking/running trail right next to the room with beautiful scenery.\nJuno was a very kind host and contacted me frequently.\nI enjoyed my stay in Austin without any stress at all.', 'The location is great. Right next to ladybird lake and the greenway. The pool is right outside the door which can get loud when there’s a group using it which wasn’t often. The mattress in bedroom was way too soft for us. It was better when one of us slept in day bed. (Otherwise we both rolled towards the middle). The actual couch is more in the walkway /hallway than the actual living room. The day bed is where you would expect the couch to be and the daybed is not comfortable to sit on.', 'The place is just as described and quietly close to downtown Austin.', 'Excellent host, clean space', 'Very cute place. Very clean. Perfect location for downtown access.', 'Beautiful location and awesome energy staying right on the boardwalk. I hope to stay here again!', 'Second time staying here and it was great.', 'Juno is a wonderful host. They made us feel right at home, and made sure we were comfortable. They gave lots of recommendations for the area, and were very responsive. The space had everything we needed. Forgot your toothbrush? Like I did… they had extras with toothpaste packets. All in all we had a great experience. We will definitely be visiting again. :)', 'This Air BNB is a great stay and wonderful value. This place seems like it would be great for long or short term stay. We stayed for 2 nights, and had everything we would’ve needed if we were staying longer. Beautiful condo, it’s decorated very nice while also being functional. The pool is an AWESOME plus, with it being steps away from the back patio door. You can also park close to the entry. It is close to lots of fun activities and yummy restaurants, and it was close to the venue we were seeing a concert at (Emos).\nVery easy check in and check out. Simple instructions. Everything was very clean, and the bed was super comfortable! Overall a beautiful place, and we would definitely stay again!', 'The apartment was clean, comfortable, and picked up. The location was amazing with the lady bird lake trail right next to the apartment. She had everything you need such as bath toiletries. I would stay here again!', 'Great condo- clean, well decorated, useful items provided, amazing location!', 'Great location!!\nComfortable and clean with the pool right at your back door!! Thank you for the wonderful stay!', 'wonderful spot with great touches to make the stay perfect', '• An excessive amount of (mostly blonde) human hair on couch pillows\n• Human hair in the ice inside freezer\n• Trash left in freezer\n• Dead cockroach in bathroom drawer\n• Blood stain on couch cover\n• Blonde human hair lining the baseboards\n• Food crumbs on living room carpet\n• Dried up urine stains on toilet seat\n• Scum on the toilet seat hinges\n• Human hair stuck under toilet seat\n• Mold on shower curtain\n• Used hair brush with human hair on it in bathroom\nTo top all of this off, the host claimed we had to pay a $50 pet fee (after the booking process was complete), although it was not mentioned in the description prior to booking. We made the host aware of our dog prior to booking, and the host didn’t mention a fee until after booking, in a message. I will also provide proof of that claim with screenshots to help explain.\n24 hour pool parties that took place outside of our door, making it nearly impossible to relax in the living room/kitchen. I understand these things are difficult to mitigate and it’s hard to manage that sort of thing as a host. However, it would be nice to know this kind of stuff in the description, so the customer who wishes to relax can avoid this booking.\nWe were also unable to wash any of our clothes, as there were no instructions on how to get into the locked washer/dryer area.\nThis is quite likely our worst experience to date.', 'Nice place, would visit again.', 'Awesome location, perfect place!', ""Decent place, well stocked, but as someone who works from home, I found the daybed/couch situation really uncomfortable-can't sit upright, and couldn't prop the pillows up for support because most of them had a very unpleasant odor.\nOtherwise, great location, right on Lady Bird lake. Spent half of my free time on the trail, and the other half at El Tacorrido across the street :)"", 'Great location, with easy access to downtown and the airport. Juno was very communicative. Easy check-in and check-out! Great food spots close to the Airbnb.', 'Cute condo right on the river! Very clean and nicely decorated. I’ve already booked the place again for my next stay.', ""Stay at Juno's place was amazing. Apartment is perfectly located on the Riverside, meaning in a busy city like Austin you can be close to the peaceful nature and enjoy walks by the lake together with all the locals, but still are close to the city. If you don't want to walk, the location makes uber-rides very affordable as well. Apartment is very spacious, has everything that you need (and probably even more) and very clean. I enjoyed really hanging in the court-side near the pool, that is also cleaned daily. As I rented a car for private parking was a must for me, and I felt totally secure in this area. Also, as I was there for business, WiFi worked perfectly for daily zoom calls and regular work. If I ever need to visit Austin again, probably will check out this same apartment again. Thank you for hosting!"", ""Juno's place was in a great location and felt safe, for a female traveling solo. The unit was clean and had coffee & creamer available.

I hope to come back again!', 'Very nice & peaceful place. Would definitely stay again', 'Juno’s place was very clean and cozy. It has access directly to the pool which was really nice. Everything you could need for a nice getaway was included. All of the furniture was comfortable…especially the couch! 10/10 recommend.', 'Juno’s home was perfect! Everything was as listed and she was readily available if we needed anything. The home is 5-10 min drive from all the main ATX attractions. So peaceful and calm and within walking distance to the lake that leads you to just about anywhere. Would definitely recommend and hope to stay again in the future.', ""Great rental in excellent location to downtown! We found it easier to Uber downtown as it was cheaper than the parking! It's steps away from bike and scooter rentals down the path along the street and kayak rentals by the lake. The path along the lake was perfect for a morning walk, run or ride. It was nice to chill in the pool after a day downtown and before heading back out for the night. The unit had all the kitchen/bathroom essentials and even floats for pool!

Julie was very accommodating and generous in being flexible with my delayed arrival.\nI highly recommend staying here! You will be glad you did.', 'We had a great stay at the Wren’s nest. The location was amazing - minutes from South Congress. We loved the amenities and Julie made check in and check out a breeze. Would gladly stay again', 'What a delightful stay in Austin! Julie’s place was perfect while I was in town for a friend’s wedding. I arrived early in the day and was able to drop my bag off before check-in time and do some exploring. You can walk to all the best of South Congress. Would stay there again in a heartbeat! Thanks Julie!', 'What a perfect spot! Perfect location to explore soco and 1st and all the rest of Austin.

The ice cold lone star beers in the fridge that greeted us upon our late balmy night check-in (which was super easy!) and the snacks were SO appreciated. We would come back here if ever in Austin!', ""Loved staying at the Wren's Nest - a little haven in the madness of SXSW. Extremely comfortable, clean and with all the amenities one needs, and a short cab drive from downtown. Would have liked to explore the neighbourhood but didn't have time. Thanks for having me!"", 'Wonderful nest in great location. The hosts were very kind and accommodating . Perfect spot for a stay cation or get away!', ""Julie's place was a perfect stay for my husband and I. Although we only stayed for a night, we definitely would've stayed longer!! The place was walkable to main street, easy to find and the studio space felt larger than we thought with high ceilings with sky light. Julie was kind enough to offer later check out and it was super helpful since I needed the space to catch up with some work. Highly recommend this place for those who visit Austin!!"", ""Ideal for a stay in Austin south of downtown. Great value given the location and excellent condition of the space — we felt uniquely at home at the Wren's Nest, and wanted for nothing by way of amenities given Julie & Mark's meaningful touches of hospitality, like setting aside guest beach towels for Barton Springs. Communication and check-in were easy as could be, and within minutes of dropping our bags we were out exploring the south Congress neighborhood. I look forward to returning to Austin and would absolutely book another stay at the Wren's Nest."", 'I felt like I won a lottery staying at Julie’s place. I was in town for a funeral service and it provided so much comfort to be in this very convenient, walking location near all my favorite Austin things. Julie is an amazing host and her place has all the amenities I didn’t even know I needed, from sunscreen to lotions to shower slippers. Her place is adorable, and decorated so nicely and I really enjoyed the sweet balcony. It felt very much like SoCo. And a bonus, a nearby neighbor apparently hosted a Miranda Lambert concert a night I was there. That was a treat to enjoy with other neighbors. Thank you so much Julie!! I miss your place much!!', 'Great location just off S Congress. Super clean, private and relaxing. Short walk to many great spots.

Easy check-in and beautiful home :) We had a lovely staycation and I\'m glad we took a few days for ourselves.\nThere\'s a few preferences that I wish I knew prior to going. For me, the incredibly soft bed was a problem. I already suffer back problems, so beds for me are a challenge, but my husband (who can sleep anywhere) complained about the bed every morning. By the final day, I was limping as I left because I hurt my back with the bed. I\'m sitting here with a heating pad as I write this. The other was the pool. We were excited for the pool and it\'s a main reason we chose this location, but #1 it was awkward to swim in someone\'s backyard when they have the blinds up and sitting in the living room and #2 Every time I thought about going out there, I kept seeing wasps, so I\'m wondering if there was a nearby nest?\nThis isn\'t intended to be a bad review.

The house and pool were also really lovely and pretty well-equipped. The towels and TP were high quality, and we also appreciated the local art.\nA few small things to note. First—and this could totally just be a thing for us—but there is no windows that open. We did notice a lot of new construction where this was also the case, but AC is not our thing and it was a bummer to not have the option to just have the windows open. Also, there is only a keurig, and we would've really appreciated another coffee-making option. And lastly, there was also only a steamer and not an iron as the listing says (maybe this only matters to me, but I do not find steamers comparable).

There were thoughtful touches, including coffee and snacks. Alex was very responsive and checked in to make sure everything was ok.\nJust a note that the main house is also rented out, including a shared yard (there was a small dog who was not thrilled with our arrival).

The place was perfect for the 2 of us and was an amazing location, walkable to Rainy street. Would stay again!', 'Wonderful hosts and a darling home. Everything spotlessly clean and very thoughtfully arranged. Convenient Uber to downtown Austin. I especially loved that they didn\'t give me a list of chores to do, like everyone else on AirBNB.

It's also close to the highway if you need to go on longer excursions. The space itself is very private, well appointed and comfortable overall. I really enjoyed being able to relax on the patio to reset after a hard day at work, before hitting the town. I also appreciated amenities such as the laundry machine (with supplied fragrance-free detergent!), coffeemaker (with supplied ground coffee!) and the rest.

Great location and cute spot!', 'Alex’s place was nice, but the two biggest issues we had were: one, we found cockroaches. We reached out and they apologized and said they’d make sure pest control comes out after our stay, BUT it’s really alarming staying somewhere with cockroaches. Also, the bed wasn’t very comfortable, that’s a very personal preference thing so may be great for others. But those 2 points are mainly what hurt my review. Also there’s no great place to sit, just a small dining table without great seats, but that is accurate to the posting. They did provide snacks, coffee, and tea which was a nice touch.\nWe also stayed during one of the hottest periods in TX so although it only took like 15-20 min to walk places, we couldn’t because the heat was too much(nothing wrong with the place in this instance, just the location not being great)\nAll in all, the place was fine for the 2 of us, but we did have a couple of not great experiences (mainly the cockroaches) that would prob. not have us stay here again.', 'Clean .

The only gripe I have is that parking can be tricky as the street the airbnb is on gets very busy.

The Google maps direction did not take me to the right block, it is up stairs as others have mentioned, and it took me 3-4 times to get the lock to open. However, self-check in is always lovely and appreciated. Unfortunately, a bizarre thing happened to me when I closed the bathroom door to the studio bedroom and it locked from the inside and I was unable to get into the bathroom. Annie and her fiancee were responsive and sadly had to come over to the unit around 10:30pm when I was hoping to be asleep and made the stay sub-par."", 'Clean and centrally located place to stay!

Thanks for being a great host, Annie!"", 'Annie was so accommodating when I booked her place last minute. Her functionally designed studio is a great place to relax for the night, clean and comfortable. The area is in a quaint, safe neighborhood adjacent to downtown and west 6th attractions. Her place had everything we needed for our short stay and we appreciated the extra self care amenities. The bathroom was surprisingly large compared to the size of the studio. I’m glad I chose her place over a hotel for the night. Wish we could’ve stayed longer!', 'I really love the finishing in this studio.\nThe black & White aesthetic is amazing.

Instead you’re in an adorable and reasonably priced little guest house in a gorgeous neighborhood. Easy walk or uber to lots of great downtown stuff; shops, food, yoga parks etc. I felt so safe secure and comfortable and there’s even an awesome soaking tub. Annie was kind, accommodating and swift in response. My only note is if you’re sensitive to air fresheners you may ask them to unplug it before you arrive as it’s a large one for a small space. But overall a total 10/10!', 'Annie was great and communicative host. The place is brand new like the photos. However a few minor issues that prevented me from giving it a 5 star.\n1) I am only 115 lbs and the bed was extremely hard to sleep on - the mattress felt like it sat on a stand and sank in underneath me when I moved. I can’t imagine 2 people sleeping on it.\n2) there was no window that was able to be opened and it felt like there wasn’t great ventilation.\n3) there was a smell of mold or mildew and the wood at the entrance seemed to be soaked - it was rainy when I stayed and it seemed to be coming in slightly onto the wood. I’m not sure if it was actual mold or mildew and I tried to air out the place a little by keeping the door open for 5 min when it wasn’t raining but every time I entered, there was still a smell.\nOtherwise the location is securely located behind a back house. And it does look like the photos.', 'Had a peaceful stay here over 2 nights. Would recommend.', 'Enjoyed my stay, simple and easy.

Lisa was prompt with communication and offered to address any issues we brought to her attention. She is amazing. Overall a great stay. I rated the overall stay 4 stars for 2 reasons. 1.) There was a smell when we initially walked into the house. Likely due to either using scent free cleaning items or little air circulation before we checked in. It was muggy when we arrived so the weather could have contributed. 2.) The AC unit was dirty. When we turned it on, dirt fell out. This could have also contributed to the smell.

It is in a very quiet location and while we couldn't walk to everything we wanted to, it was close enough to venture out for meals. Even when we had to drive, everything was within 15 minutes. The best thing about this location was the host. They had some work being done to the house prior to our arrival and it tripped a circuit breaker for the hot water heater. We didn't know until 9:30 PM that we didn't have hot water. I messaged Lisa, she responded right away and got us taken care of. In addition, the clean up she expected was very reasonable.

Exactly what I was looking for.', 'The space was compact, but beautiful and spotlessly clean. Paula has a passion for detail, and she is very responsive. The art was beautiful. The “Lucky Lounge” art is great, but it means so much more when you read the background that Paula provides. Thanks so much!', 'This is a small space. Recommend for single travelers. The shower is nice. Comfortable bed but if you taller than 5’5 expect your feet hanging off the bed. The porch light for the front door rounds up lots of light bugs and if your not quick enough they will come into the room.

The location was great, close and convenient to the airport and the city, but far enough away from both to avoid the traffic and noise. The street felt very safe and it was a quiet place to rest from all of our activities in Austin. It was a short walk to catch the bus to the city and the airport.

Exactly as described in photos and perfect space for a couple staying in Austin! Casita was clean,internet was fast, and bed was comfy!

Includes a Keurig and electronic kettle, good selection of knives, nice dishes, full-size fridge appreciated. I want good, reliable wifi; good bed with good linens; thick towels; good hot water/pressure; secure parking for car. These are all there, with an excellent desk/chair for working on laptop. Bathroom is OK and yes the shower is really small, to wash adequately I needed to leave the curtain aside, which meant water getting on the floor, but it's workable. Long driveway and needed to drive backwards to get to street. If you need something, host will provide. Suburban neighborhood is quiet but I was in Austin for business not bars, and was easily able to get to where I needed to go. Austin is expensive and despite the minor shortcomings, this is good value. Would book again."", 'Great communications, clean place and great for a short stay.

We would definitely stay here again.\nMatthew and Mayra were very nice and communication was easy!', 'Matthew was a kind & responsive host, so I’m giving this stay five stars despite a few issues during our time here. On the first day the hot water was not working, but after texting Matthew we were able to get it resolved for the rest of our stay. We also noticed some tiny bugs in the house, a leak in the bathroom sink, and had difficulty getting in & out as the front door required a lot of strength to close fully. After letting our host know, Matthew apologized & graciously offered a partial refund for the stay without us even asking, assuring us that they will look into & fix these for future guests. Otherwise, this was a nice guest house, perfectly sized, well furnished, and complete with all the necessities. Love that there was a basket of snack bars & instant oats in the kitchen. Location was not bad at all— everything we wanted to do in Austin was very quick to get to. The issues we had did not prevent us from enjoying our trip and I recommend Matthew as a host you can trust.', ""Great clean, comfortable and affordable place. won't hesitate to stay here!"", 'Best stay I’ve had.

You are getting what you paid for. Hosts are very accommodating and the secretive parking slot is appreciated. We did have an issue with no hot water at first but Matthew quickly got on it and fixed it. Downtown Austin is crazy expensive and this is a perfect choice to avoid that.

Photo’s were extremely accurate. Check in and checkout was extremely easy. Very responsive and helpful hosts. Highly recommend this stay!', 'thank you for the stay', ""Everything was as advertised. The accommodations were perfectly acceptable. The only issue is that BnB's in Austin are way too expensive. Its really sad to think how a hut in someone's back yard in East Austin costs $115 a night. I'm concerned that BnB and their hosts are making a killing off this market. The profits must be unimaginable. This is making Austin less and less appealing to visit."", 'Great private place to stay with street parking and one spot in a driveway. Easy check in and cool location I’d recommend to anyone.

The neighborhood was quiet, safe as I was a solo traveler and if your a sucker for creative spaces the homes surrounding were equally as nice. Everyone I spoke to in passing was so nice. Chris place is far enough away from the downtown hustle and bustle but also close enough that a car isn’t needed. I used Uber and the cost per ride never exceeded $10 which I loved.

Super efficient layout, incredibly quiet and private, and above all for me, a respite from a days festivities out in Austin. If you need a nice place to lay your head, that has exactly the right amount amenities with out being overboard, this is it. Great price, easy access and good location. It's a solid place for anyone (or a couple) who would normally just get a hotel room, because they are just in town for the city and its attractions. Anything you are going to need are already there, and Ubering anywhere you might want to be is inexpensive. Think of it like taking the best parts of your home with you one the road, or at least that is what it felt like for me. All in all a perfect stay for me."", ""Chris's studio was very comfortable for a several night stay - it's in a great neighborhood - tucked away off busy streets but easily walkable to a host of great East Austin restaurants, coffee shops, and bars.

Easy check in and check out.', 'Really enjoyed my stay! Great location and size for the price.', 'I would stay here again when I am in Austin.

Chris and Martina were very understanding about my late arrival. Perfect location in East Austin.', 'Chris was a great host and responded timely with every inquiry I had! The place was beautiful and despite being small, he included all the extra little touches to make the space functional and homely. I did offer the suggestion to him to add a mirror in the main area to aid in more than one person getting ready simultaneously. Also, oddly enough the sink light in the bedroom/living area is tied into the ceiling fan— so in order to leave the fan on to sleep, the light is shining right into the bed. A simple oscillating fan would solve this issue and Chris was receptive to my feedback to make his place even better! I would 100% recommend this apartment for anyone visiting the Austin area!', 'Had a great experience here. Great location with close proximity to everything we wanted to do. Had no troubles whatsoever.', 'The place was pretty peaceful. Cozy and relaxing, a nice little couples hangout when being in Austin.

I would recommend this place everyone when in Austin :)', 'I absolutely LOVED this place. It is close to pretty much everything and the neighborhood is quite and peaceful!

The place was cozy and close to town.', 'Chris was an excellent host. Upon arrival, I could not locate the code for the lock in our message thread. Chris responded very quickly and was helpful about how to work the lock.\nUnfortunately, the air conditioner was not working properly, so we were not able to stay the full duration of our trip; however, as soon as we let Chris know, he called a technician out, and promptly refunded us for the remaining nights of the stay.\nIt was a lovely place, and and Chris was super helpful and responsive.', 'Nice place, in a very convenient area of town. Easy to get to and good instructions.', 'I absolutely loved my stay in this studio. The space was very roomy and comfortable, and the area was quiet and a breezy walk or drive to the downtown area. Chris and Martina were very friendly and checked in occasionally to ensure I was taken care of, which I was incredibly thankful for. The kitchenette also had keurig for fresh coffee in the morning — it was a lovely surprise to find. I will definitely stay again on my next trip to Austin!', 'We came to Austin for a long weekend to explore the city during the day and to experience comedy and music scene in the evening. The location of the apartment was just right to help us accomplish our objective. Both Lyft and Uber offered rides for less than $10 to and from downtown and 6th street.\nThe place itself is just as described. It met all of our needs and it made us feel truly comfortable. And, it is private, clean and tastefully furnished.\nI would recommend contacting the host to my friends and we would stay there again.']",['2 guests · 1 bedroom · 1 bed · 1 bath'],https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/793611557583559548?adults=1&children=0&enable_m3_private_room=true&infants=0&pets=0&search_mode=regular_search&check_in=2024-11-10&check_out=2024-11-15&source_impression_id=p3_1729616558_P3bKfb1m6OkKDkf3&previous_page_section_name=1000&federated_search_id=1e4cce73-6535-450a-9d50-10cfa3cea9cd

The place was as described, and there were many complimentary items that the host left which was nice. They also had a binder full of recommendations which was helpful.\nSomething I wish I knew beforehand was that inside of the place is very one directional- meaning you have to walk through each room to get to another room. This was slightly problematic since the bathroom is in the middle of the three living spaces. Also, the host asked that we leave the humidifier and fan on in the bedroom which was not the best since they were loud and it was already super cold outside. They had a portable heater for us to use which worked okay. Overall, it was a decent place with beautiful outdoor space.', ""We loved our stay at Lauren and Tod's place!

It's super cute and has great design (I'm an interior designer lol so I really appreciate it when an airbnb is this cute and thoughtful design-wise!)\nIt was easy to find, felt private and had a great space to sit out and enjoy the day/evening.\nWe were in Austin for some concerts and the night we came back from a show, we sat out on the deck and had a great time talking, snacking and enjoying the night.\nThey've really made great use of the space!

It doesn’t cool down until 11pm at night which is ridiculous. Upstairs where the bed is so bad I had to sleep on a pull out coach. They should have fans in this place running 24/7.

As the other reviews note, the location is quaint for being in a college area (surrounded by frat houses) and is a good distance from downtown. We were able to pick up some scooters to get to where we were going and get downtown in about 20 mins. I found the place could’ve been cleaner as I found a few hairs around the couch/in the fridge but otherwise good. Bed was comfy. There was construction going on in the apartment next door so the noise woke us up a couple times but otherwise no issues. Christine is very friendly and helpful but at times we felt rushed to check-out as they ask multiple times what time you’re planning on checking out.

Possible solution: Send all codes again, maybe at check-in time)\nThe view is gorgeous from the balcony!!!!!\nVery cute setup.The tile floor did appear to need mopping near the balcony door, and the bathroom may need a deep clean pertaining to grout, but the unit was fine. Nothing major to contact the host about, in my opinion. The smell in the shower was a bit pungent; yet, I am certain the hosts are unable to rectify that issue on their own.\nI did not care for the form about check-in & out times when the link gave an opportunity to purchase early check-in or late check out.

Texted Christine and she did try to fix the problem, but after multiple attempts (+ we couldn’t even do anything because router was not in our room) we had to use a phone hotspot to use the TV. Second: While the rules state that there should be no loud noises between 9PM and 8AM, the room next to us hosted a party from 10PM-3AM, and we barely slept. Again, the location of this place was great, but the problems we had with the internet and others hosting parties did not match our expectations and we are unsatisfied, therefore we were disappointed by the value of the rental.', 'Very nice clean space!

Although I would not recommend if a Wi-Fi connection is needed during your because it was seriously inconsistent and I was not able to connect for the majority of my stay. However, for me Wi-Fi was not a priority. When I had trouble checking in (user error), the host was prompt and very helpful and friendly with responses. Although I could tell the unit was going through some renovations, it was still decorated well and had beautiful views. Literally everything you could want or need is within walking distance.

However while the location was great, there were some issues with the apartment. Most of the kitchen equipment was in a bad state, the pots and pans were so scratched that you basically couldn't use them to cook anymore, and the coffee machine produces coffee with an extremely unhealthy taste, and should probably be replaced.\nSome parts of the apartment also seemed like they were still under construction, for example the floor does not extend all the way to the terrace door, and there is a big hole in the interior roof of the room that stores the cleaning equipment. Also, the sink in the bathroom seemed to have issues and only drained extremely slowly.\nNone of this was tragic individually, but overall it makes the costs for the apartment seem too high, especially when many of these issues should be fairly cheap to fix."", 'The apt took hours to get cool.

The people in the connected house did not make a lot of noise nor were they any inconvenience whatsoever, I only mention it as an FYI. someone did even make sure that we knew that our DoorDash person had arrived which I thought was very sweet.

We loved our stay and it was close to a really nice strip of bars and restaurants.', 'This spot was perfect for us and our doggos. It was very near all the places we wanted to go in Austin and was a very clean and welcoming space. We will definitely be back and highly recommend!', 'Made a last minute booking and it couldn’t have worked out any better. Checked in even later than expected when my flight was delayed, but the lights and AC were on, all ready for me. I was given clear instructions on how to find the place, and while I wasn’t 100% sure since it was 0200 (dark, but outside lights were on), I was in the right place after all. It’s the wooden gate in the back of the house.\nPleasantly surprised with how nice the place was. A little bigger than I had expected. The bed is SO large and comfortable. Honestly, wanted to stay longer! Shower is nice and plenty of bathroom counter space for all my toiletries, makeup, etc. Loved the yard for my pup! They left 2 bags of chips which I really appreciated! I was impressed with the Brita filter, I hate having to go buy a bunch of gallons of water! Only feedback on that is that the filter light was out, so I’m not sure if it was a new filter or not. Great stay and extremely close to downtown and the river.', 'We loved the Airbnb, it was close proximity to where we had to go. Everything was advertised correctly. All accommodations were met. Ben was super responsive to any of our needs. I would definitely recommend this studio again to other family members and friends. Looking forward to staying there again in the near future.', 'We absolutely loved our stay at Ben’s place. He was very accommodating and the place was exactly as described - the comfy king size bed and huge bathroom were awesome :)\nThe area is also fantastic - close to so many great bars and restaurants. We would definitely return!', 'Great location, comfy space :)', ""Ben's place was fantastic. Great location with lots of restaurants, coffee, ice cream and shops in walking distance. Quiet and quaint neighborhood and an easy drive to other parts of Austin. The studio and bathroom were clean and as described and Ben's instructions for entry made it super easy to gain entry."", 'Great location, close to everything else but not too close. 2nd time staying here and will definitely stay again.', 'We really enjoyed our stay, this is the perfect weekend getaway location. The east side of Austin has so much to do you can walk to many food and drink options or grab a short uber to other neighborhoods. Very comfortable apartment with the basics for a relaxing stay.', 'Ben’s place was clean and overall pleasant to stay in! Great location and a walkable neighborhood. We had one issue with a lock on an internal door to the laundry and that we could not securely lock this from the visitor’s side, which felt a little unnerving. Overall the host was a good communicator and the space was very pretty otherwise.', 'Great location to walk throughout the whole city ! Very quiet location so perfect for a weekend get away!', ""My fiancé and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Ben's place. It was the perfect couples spot and felt spacious. It was great each having our own sink space and a comfy king bed. We weren't more than a 10-15 minute Lyft ride from anything cool in Austin. We would definitely stay again!"", 'Ben was easy to coordinate with when we came to visit Austin. We had a car with us and were able to park right outside next to the side entrance to the private suite. His place is in an excellent location in the center of Austin, so it was easy to explore different parts of the city. The tub was also very relaxing, and I would highly recommend others to use it to de-stress!', 'We needed a place to stay that way close to my husband\'s office. Ben\'s place was in the perfect spot. Close to my husband\'s office, an entrance to the hike & bike trail was just down the road, neighborhood is quiet & safe, easy access to I-35, and walkable or short Uber to all the fun restaurants , bars, & breweries. Bed was comfortable, loved the stone tile in the shower, and quiet/peaceful at night for a good night\'s rest. The AC cooled the place down perfectly for a few hot July days. I worked remotely from Ben\'s place, and the wifi was fast and it was quiet during the day too. One of the days we stayed was a trash/recycle day so the trucks coming for the bins was the only ""loud"" momentary noise. Our pug, Maggie, enjoyed walking around the neighborhood for potty breaks. There was not much grass in the fenced yard area, it\'s a shaded area so it\'s harder for the grass to grow. We would definitely stay at Ben\'s place again in the future!', 'Thank you so much for a fantastic vacation! We had a great time relaxing in this studio and it was in the perfect location for getting food and drinks!', 'Great location. Very walkable, close to the trails on the river/lake. Ben was so awesome- we needed up arriving quite late and he recommended places we could walk for late night food/drinks. Bathroom is so nice and roomy. Bed is big and comfortable. Great place overall!', 'Awesome spot to stay! Walkable to Lady Bird Lake trail, 5 min Uber to Rainey street and east 6 bars. Super comfy bed, nice and private (little bit of noise from top floor of house but nothing crazy), and the tub with bath salts and spa type shower was definitely a highlight. 100% would stay here again!', 'We loved our stay here, felt at home instantly. It’s walking distance to Lady Bird Lake and many parks, a few blocks from multiple coffee/food spots as well. SUPER COMFY bed, spacious bathroom, quiet and cute neighborhood, iPhone chargers on each side of the bed. VERY CLEAN AND CUTE AIRBNB! This place is everything we hoped for during our trip to Austin and will definitely be returning asap!', 'This was perfect for a long weekend of exploring Austin! We had a rental car that made the entire city fairly accessible (nothing was more than a 15 minute drive), but the neighborhoods around Ben’s place are full of gems that a lot of travelers likely miss. We found the space to be tidy, well-equipped with necessities, and a much-needed respite from the intense Texas heat. 10/1 would recommend and stay again!', 'Thank you!', 'Great place for a getaway!', 'Thanks!', ""Everything about this place was perfect. It's in a great location close to the Lady Bird Lake Trail and the best cafes/restaurants/bars of East Austin. Also, the bed is huge and incredibly comfortable, and the bathtub is *chef's kiss*. Thanks, Ben!"", 'This is our 4th or 5th time staying here. Very cozy spot, away from downtown but not too far.', 'Very cozy place, will definitely book again. Close to lady bird lake and about 10 minutes from most downtown locations.', 'Good host, rasy to navigate to bnb, great location for a few days.', 'Great place to stay for 2, Would come back again.', 'Fantastic stay! Will definitely book again.', 'Ben was super responsive and replied any time I texted. We love the neighborhood and NYE was super lively. The bars and food options are amazing.\nThe room is really comfy, amenities listed were just as they appeared. The bathroom is spacious and so calming. My only complaint is the polyester sheets. That was a little bit of a disappointment. Everything else was 5 stars.', 'This place was cozy, comfortable and close to so many sites and restaurants near downtown Austin yet far enough away to feel at home. I struggled a little to find it originally, but that’s because we arrived at night and didn’t read the original note from the host very well. 😅', 'Had great stay and really appreciated Ben accommodating a last minute booking for the same day. The bed was comfortable and the room was well appointed. Would definitely stay again!', 'We had a great stay!

Ben welcomed my fur babies openly and was very accommodating. There is lots to do in this area.', 'Ben was highly responsive, and his home was beautiful. I plan to return.', 'Beautiful little spot - such a nice escape from the SXSW hubbub. Quiet, chill, and so nice to have that big tub!', 'We had two nights in Austin before heading somewhere else and this spot worked perfect for us. The tall ceilings and big bathroom made the space feel huge. The bed and linens were super cozy and we were greeted with the a/c already on and some nice music on the radio. It made us feel right at home. Restaurants in the neighborhood weren’t reliably open or very walkable, but we managed to find an amazing ice cream shop nearby (called Gati) that stole our hearts. (As well as Cenote for breakfast and Cosmic for coffee.) Thanks for the stay Ben. We’d book here in the future if we ever come through town again.', ""Ben's space was a great value for being in East Austin. The space is a nice home base if you're planning to spend a trip in Austin out and about and just need a place to rest your head. The apartment has all the amenities you need from wifi to a smart tv, a fridge, mini-kitchen space, etc. The bed is super comfy.""]",['2 guests · 1 bedroom · 1 bed · 1 bath'],https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/5601570?adults=1&children=0&enable_m3_private_room=true&infants=0&pets=0&search_mode=regular_search&check_in=2024-11-17&check_out=2024-11-22&source_impression_id=p3_1729616588_P3XGh9-O0gMlOIYx&previous_page_section_name=1000&federated_search_id=7e5c09b8-c4fa-4fa7-a125-532510734e58
