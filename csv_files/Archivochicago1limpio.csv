The room is clean and it's very nice to have a private bathroom. The instructions for checking in and and opening the room are clear.\nThe bed is indicated as a queen size, but according to Dutch standards it is a doubter (1.20 m wide). So bigger than a single bed but smaller than a standard double bed. As a result, I had to be careful with turning around in your sleep because if you sleep in it with two of you, you don't have much room for movement.\nFurthermore, great room in a quiet neighborhood where it is nice and quiet at night."", 'Very nice host, area, and place! Loved my stay:) (only thing is maybe bring a pillow or two if you are picky abt pillows.)', 'This place has good transport connections (there are bus connections to trains but you can get to most central locations within about 40 mins total) and offers good value for money. The neighborhood is nice and quiet - we had good breakfast in a nearby cafe at the start of each day but preferred to get dinner in the city, and there are two awesome bookshops nearby as well.

The whole Airbnb (kitchen and living room too) was so cute! I loved the high ceilings, character and charm. I could sometimes hear people above me moving around which was to be expected with a multi level building, but it didn‚Äôt disrupt my sleep or stay at all.

It is also very practical to the center and not more than 25 minutes by truck. The Pilsen area is beautiful, very safe, very quiet to return home at night. I recommend walking down 18th Street, as there are always a lot of people. There are several very good restaurants in the area, I recommend ""Los Comales"" Mexican food on Calle 18..

First time visiting Chicago and had a great room to rest up during the night!', 'The Bohemian Lodge hits the sweet spot between cost and quality. Six blocks West of the river, six South of the University, and right in the middle of the chillest neighborhood we were walking distance from Grant Park and the southern half of downtown. Plentiful street parking saved us money than we spent on Lyfts, scooters, bikes, AND the L, all while saving the hassel of parking downtown-downtown. Cute signs around the lodge answered most questions as they arose. after texting to ensure we had no issues checking in our host was only ever a text awaying, though we encountered no issues that warranted attention. An excellent hybrid between renting a full unit and just renting a room.

The room was very private and the bathroom was immaculate. Even the apartment was clean and felt very homey. If you‚Äôre a super light sleeper, you may hear a creak or two from the upstairs floor but I was able to sleep like a log.

Denise communicates well, gives clear instructions, and checks up on you during your stay. Since the location is near bus stations, we used public transportation, which was so convenient. One thing to note is that from the listing and the signs at the house, the instructions and expectations may seem like a lot, but they are easy to follow, and I respect that they intend to provide an excellent stay for all of their guest. 10/10 for location, communication, and overall stay."", 'It is in a typical old neighborhood of Chicago, with a bus 200 meters away and 100 meters away, they leave you in downtown in a few minutes.\nThe house is very old but modernized inside , comforting ,clean and bright.\nWe felt very comfortable in the 1st.piso room.', ""This was such a wonderful place to stay during my first visit to Chicago for a conference. McCormick Place was a quick and affordable Uber ride away. I also felt comfortable walking around the neighborhood and absolutely loved the book store right across the street.

Really enjoyed my stay in this place.', 'It‚Äôs amazing, you feel like home\nIt‚Äôs full equipped, clean, comfortable, has some bus stations near. Top experience', 'The building itself is beautiful, but like the description says parking can be extremely hard to find. My best friend and I stayed there and wished the owners had opted for a queen bed instead of a full size as they had enough room for one and would do wonders for people traveling in pairs. The bed was well loved that slanted towards the head of the bed that left me pretty sore in the mornings. We were on the main floor and our door has several cracks in it allowing us to essentially see through the door and hear every sound. Since it is a shared spaced the foot traffic at various times woke us up and people forgot to turn off lights. There is also no AC so be mindful of this fact when staying there in the summer. On our last night we found an ant infestation on the left side of the bed. They had crawled on the wall and into the bed so sleep that night was reduced to a couple of hours with crawling sensations every now and then. The neighborhood is convient to some restaurants.', 'This property is co-hosted by Joyce and we had a great experience. Joyce was very quick to communicate and was very helpful throughout the process.\nWe arrived during the Dec snowstorm(around Christmas) and stayed in room 1. Unfortunately, the heating was not up to par the first night, but Joyce quickly resolved the issue the 2nd day and we had no further problems.\nThe property is located close to Pilsen 18th Street, which is a great location with many restaurants and things to do in the area. I really enjoyed my stay at this property and would be happy to visit again in the future.\nOne suggestion I would make is to consider taking a room downstairs if the temperature falls below -5 degrees. Other than that, I had a great experience at this Airbnb property and would highly recommend it to others.', 'Great location and walkable to a lot of local places. Joyce was responsive and friendly which made the trip more enjoyable.', 'Despite not being in the center, it has quick access roads to get there. The home is like pictures. Quiet area, privacy between rooms. Clean and tidy common areas. Good wifi signal. It is very local neighborhood so there is no type of commerce, the closest is a 24 hrs donalds to 15-20 min walk. Joyce was in constant communication. Very good value for money. Recommended for staying.', 'Such a great find! Joyce was such a great and responsive host. The neighborhood was walkable and not too far away from things to eat/do. The place was also very secure!', 'the host was friendly, the place was as the description said, the check-in instructions were clear', 'An ideal house to rest , clean and with easy access .

I highly recommend her place if you‚Äôre looking for an affordable, clean space!', 'If you are looking for a private and budget accommodation in Chicago, this is the place! A great place at a good price to stay in Chicago. Being a little further away from the center allows you to be more economical and affordable and you can reach the center by bus and/or train without problems. We really liked having our private bathroom inside the bedroom and having a password on the bedroom door. Good privacy, although there were more guests we barely noticed them (they were on the lower floor) and both our room and the common parts (living room and kitchen) were clean and well-equipped. Good communication from Joyce at all times, very good treatment!', 'We loved this place, with its combination of old, but renovated rooms, kitchen and living room. And a laundry too! Just what we travelers needed. Highly recommended!', 'The place was very nice. Sufficient and all is clean and Ok.\nThe area is nice to walk and there are restaurants and convenient stores close.', ""Pilsen is a very quiet neighborhood, and although the metro stations are 18 to 20 minutes from the site, the city's integration system between metro and bus makes it much easier. Pink or Orange line, bus, 18 or 8 are good options. About the room we stayed in, everything is perfect; very clean, warm and spacious. We only feel talking about a TV, but it is dispensable. Great value for the price, I recommend it to all."", 'My stay was great! Loved the location; I felt very safe with the multiple locking doors.

Thank you!', ""The room was very spacious, comfortable, and clean. It was great to have a private bathroom and a kitchen right outside the room. The area is very nice, friendly people and lots of Mexican places within walking distance. I was traveling for business, it's commutable by bus or a quick Uber to the McCormick Convention Center. Joyce was an amazing host, very friendly and responsive. I asked for some additional hangars and she was very happy to provide them. The only downside of my stay was that building doesn't have great sound insulation so I heard my neighbors sometimes during the night, just something to know if you are sensitive to noise as I am. It was doable with earplugs. Thank you Joyce!"", ""Joyce was a great host! When I got there, it was very tidy and close to downtown and the United Center. It was also in a quiet neighborhood. Not really much more you could ask for! I will be here again whenever I'm in the area!"", 'We spend a week at the Joyce‚Äôs home. It was our first time in a shared space and was a very good experience. Everything worked well and we felt like in our own home. The apartment is located in a very good place.

It was exactly like the photos and description, very clean and the bed super comfortable. The only thing I'd comment on is the futon bed - we planned to have one of us sleeping on it but it was quite uncomfortable and I'd say only really suitable for a small child/someone really not fussed at all (and we're not particularly fussy). However, the main bed was so super comfortable and it was fine for two friends to share.\nThe local neighbourhood of Logan Square was within a walkable reach and full of lovely restaurants, shops, bars etc. We also went to the two very local restaurants recommended by Cindy, Monster Ramen (also in the recent NYT list of the best restaurants in Chicago) and L'pastor.

The apartment had everything one could want in terms of amenities and is easy to find, and the bed was super comfortable. Neighbourhood felt safe and fun.

Nathan was very responsive, greeted us with such kindness you would have thought we were long lost friends, and he gave us a tour around his home asking us to enjoy the shared amenities (including a beautiful balcony space) like it was our own home. Full disclosure- this is the first time I have stayed in a shared room on AirBnB (have always done entire space rentals) so I was unsure of what to expect for privacy. After Nathan offered us some suggestions for his local favorites based on our interests, he stepped out for a few hours and we didn‚Äôt interact much until check out, which was exactly what we were expecting and enjoyed. We spent most of our weekend out & about, so beyond sleeping at Nathan‚Äòs we really didn‚Äôt get to enjoy the amenities as much as we would have liked to.

It‚Äôs very well located in west town, and near public transportation and the freeway entrance. Parking is limited ‚Äî only one nearby street, Pearson, is non-permit. I feel compelled to warn future guests about several worrisome aspects of this Airbnb, though. Gavin kept to himself, but often felt compelled to reveal aspects of his life to me I felt inappropriate when we were not friends. For large chunks of my long term stay, Gavin and his girlfriend (who is lovely) fought through the night. On one occasion, they were screaming and crying so intensely I felt I couldn‚Äôt even come home. Gavin never addressed these issues with me, instead ignoring it. When his girlfriend got covid Gavin similarly failed to tell me she had tested positive, instead making her do so. I had tell Gavin I knew about the covid because he failed to communicate about it at all with me, and it was again me, the guest, who put house covid protocol in place. As the Airbnb host I think Gavin should be handling these situations ‚Äî not his girlfriend, not his guests. Other reviewers have noted they appreciate how Gavin treats you like an old friend, but I think this type of treatment crosses a line.

Even for 2 it\'s a bit crowded. But good if just need a place to crash for the night. The shower is absolutely awesome (never been to an Airbnb that had a prostate stimulator in the shower before, haha). My wife had the perfect feedback, though: The host should have taken some of what he spent on the shower and spent it on a bed. The bed was actually a sofabed, so wasn\'t super comfy. As a host, Zane was responsive. The place was clean and we\'ll equipped for the size, but there is still a bit of ""renovation"" left undone that others mentioned. We did hear a lot of creaking from the host moving around above. Ultimately, it wasn\'t a bad place, but I\'d probably take my chances with someplace else before I\'d stay here again.', 'Zane‚Äôs place was very clean but tight.

The location is convenient especially for taking the L around the city, and the neighborhood is delightful.\nI found it a bit challenging navigating the several doors and up/down stairs. The stairs are short and of varying height in at least one case (older building) and so you just need to watch your footing especially when navigating with a suitcase. I am not very old but found it a bit tricky. Also, the deadbolt on one door was very hard to open when I tried coming back at night, which was alarming, as I thought for a while that I was locked out. There are multiple doors in the back, so I would advise people to pay close attention when first entering, on how to get back in. Also, bring a flashlight or headlamp to navigate the doors/steps if planning to return at night."", 'Great location!', 'It was my best airbnb experience! Edwin was flexible about checkin and checkout times, they had all the little things a traveler might need (like umbrella, for example). Super clean and good location right next to a train/bus stop.

It was clean and very close to metro - literally takes 1 minute to walk. There is a nice coffee shop and taco place nearby and a local grocery store.

Plenty of restaurants nearby. Neighborhood is safe.', 'Jill and Nala are lovely and we had a lovely time getting to know them during the day and check in was really easy.\nAt night though, 2 out of the 4 nights were really loud and disruptive.\nA friend was over to help the host film for an audition but that didn‚Äôt start until 10pm just down the hallway. He seemed lovely and we said hello but then didn‚Äôt expect for the night to turn out quite as it did‚Ä¶at about midnight the noises from the bedroom started - everyone has desires, but it was very loud and was then followed by music and talking out on the balcony which is right outside the guest bedroom. This felt a little disrespectful towards us and did keep us awake.\nThe third night the host was out but then on return from the concert - we could then hear what they were up to in their room, loudly. Again, we get it - it was just a bad nights sleep for us. At least this time there was no going out onto the balcony after like the night before. It just felt awkward and like we were imposing on someone‚Äôs life and like we shouldn‚Äôt have been there.\nJill is so lovely, and the apartment was a good location for us, but we just felt awkward and it wasn‚Äôt quite what we had expected. On the trip we are on alone we have stayed in 10 air BnBs and this one sadly fell a little short. The layout is unfortunate that the kitchen and bathroom are right by the guest bedroom, so again - great for guests but if you‚Äôre a light sleeper and people are going in and out of these it can wake you.\nAgain though, it‚Äôs hard to write this as Jill is lovely, nala is beautiful and location is good.

People who lived in this particular area seemed pretty friendly. If it's your first time in Chicago a few advice if booking this Airbnb:\n1.) Take pink line train (loop) to downtown and make sure to get Ventra Card or use the app on your phone and scan it with your Apple or Google Pay\n2.) Be prepared to walk a lot. I think we made like 17k steps one of the days because Chicago is so huge!\n3.) Plan out your days especially if you are using a CityPass for Chicago!

Thank you Erik! ‚ò∫Ô∏è', ""Here's what you need to know about staying here with Erik.\n1.) The house is clean and cozy with a eclectic amount of memorabilia. I like the bedroom, but getting to the bed is a little tricky. By no means is it difficult, its just a couple of steps up to the bed. It's just a little slippery especially with socks. I think some carpet or dense matts could make going up a little less sketchy.\n2.) The neighborhood has a good amount of restaurants and is close to public transportation. It's also peaceful and safe.\n3.) Erik's familia is very kind and welcoming people. They made me feel welcomed and accepted.\n4.) Erik himself is a very affable and good natured person. He helped direct me to some very cool restaurants and spots to frequent. Don't hesitate to ask him yourself, because he's genuinely a great guy\nOverall I'd definitely recommend staying here if your coming to visit Chicago."", 'I was treated not just as a guest, but as a family member', ""The room and all amenities were perfectly curated to meet every need of a houseguest, and Erik was super responsive, friendly, helpful, and made sure the entire process was smooth. Erik's family (and the doggos!) are wonderful and make you feel right at home. The location of the house was also perfect for me since it's a short walk/bus to the metro station and you can be in the Loop area within 30-40 minutes. It was the perfect stay, and I couldn't have asked for more! I look forward to returning to Chicago and staying at the AirBnB again. 10/10 would highly recommend!"", 'Great location , very close to the airport, welcome and hospitality I exceed expectations !', 'This is what Airbnb should be: hospitality extended on the part of the family that lives there. Not wannabe hoteliers buying up all the properties. This is a warm stay and real hospitality.', 'This was a great stay to accommodate my last minute travel plans. I took an Uber from Midway for about $10, Erik was great at communicating the whole time and his mother was lovely and very accommodating. Comfortable space and great location.', ""Had another great stay at Erik's place. As always, Erik was courteous and helpful. The location is very convenient, walking distance to CTA Midway station and the airport entrance. Erik's place has a lot of resources and his guest book was endearing to read/sign, with messages from others from all over the world who also enjoyed their stay. I particularly appreciated the tips for getting around locally and suggestions for places to check out. Though this stay was short and not for leisure (had to travel due to family emergency), I found it helpful to know which places were good to get food from for cheap. Though traveling during a pandemic is not something I was planning on having to do, I appreciated the temperature checks. The price of this AirBnb is unbeatable, especially considering its proximity to the airport and ease of access to the rest of the city. Highly recommend to any guests looking to explore the city (especially post-COVID) or just needing a cheap but clean and comfortable place to crash for the night."", ""Erik is so easy to communicate and he responds quickly. He‚Äôs always willing to help with basically everything (laundry and water boiling etc) during my stay. The entire room is very cozy, and the book collection is impressive. The neighborhood is quiet and safe. It‚Äôs also not too far away from downtown & has relatively easy access to metro. Would absolutely recommend!\nOne tiny point: I needed to go to the ORD airport twice to say goodbye to two friends, and it took me long to get there. Aside from this, the location is quite good.\n*The two dogs in the housing are the most perfect creatures in the world!\nThe value for money is relatively high. It's about a 23-minute drive to the city center and Chinatown. The subway station is about a 10-minute walk away, so you can get around in the city. Because it's a little far from the ord to the south. The people are really nice to live in. I've been working in China for a long time and will chat a little in Chinese. It's very chill. If you need a very cheap temporary place to stay (including long-term rentals), and you don't mind sharing a bathroom (it won't be clean). You can consider that the grandmother and aunt here are also very nice to greet you every day."", 'Awesome Host very hands on and attentive to needs and situational events. Aims to please and goes the extra mile!', ""Room was clean and mostly as advertised, and while some of the amenities listed in the description were out of date, I didn't really need to use them as I was out exploring the city most of the day, and I already notified Erik, so he may have updated them already. Erik was a great host, and helped me out with anything I needed. The bunk bed may be a bit hard to get in and out of for someone with a bigger frame like myself, but it is very comfortable. I'd highly recommend the Red Room for anyone coming to Chicago to visit, especially if they fly in and out of Midway (even though I flew ORD this round!)"", 'OH MY LITERAL GOD WHAT A VALUE. Erik is a wonderful hands off host which makes you very comfortable but it his family home so you feel like you are a member of the family!

Their home is conveniently located near the airport and I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Chicago!"", ""I had a great week-long stay at Erik's place. His family were very welcoming and hospitable, and they made me feel right at home. The location was great too. It was at a walkable distance to midway airport (roughly 20 minutes walk), where you could take the orange line into downtown. If 20 minutes is too much for you, you could take either 63W or 59W to midway airport; the stops for both of them are located at a distance of 5 - 7 minutes' walk from the house. In addition, Erik is a very friendly host, who gave me great recommendations and advice to navigate the town.

Thanks Erik!', 'The Red Room was perfect. Erik and his family were welcoming and informative. The bed was super comfy and clean. The home is about 20-25 min drive from Millennium Park.

My partner & I were not able to sleep in the bed itself. We tried & we were afraid of breaking the frame or hurting ourselves. Erik suggested we purchase an air mattress & try to return it before we leave, but we weren‚Äôt willing to risk it. We ended up lifting the mattress & sleeping on the floor.\nMy partner & I tried to contact support about the issue and they ended up contacting Erik. He called us frustrated. He was helpful, but very pushy & came off very condescending.\nOther than this situation, this place was great. Erik was never there, but his mom was, & was very kind!

I would definitely stay here again.', 'It‚Äôs a nice stay given the price and it‚Äôs pretty convenient. Just few blocks away from the great west loop districts and it‚Äôs super clean. The only downside would be ordering deliveries would be slightly difficult and it‚Äôs close to the subway so it may get noisy sometimes, however with a price like this, it‚Äôs still good deal.', 'Good place.

All in all it was an okay stay.', ""This apartment is not for everyone as mentioned in other reviews, but it was satisfactory for our stay.\nWe came prepared with construction-grade earplugs for the train noise right outside our window while we slept. We got used to it though, and it really wasn't that bad. There were also many aggressive drivers honking their horns at night, or people revving their engines, shouting, etc.\nThis unit was in an excellent, convenient location for our needs. Could not have asked for better.\nTwo reasons why I give this 4 stars:\n1. There is no elevator. Walking up 8 flights of stairs can be brutal, especially after long nights out or just hauling your luggage up to the unit. If you stay here, you need to pack light.\n2. I got the impression that Sara wasn't a real person. A day before we discussed an early check-in, because no one was staying there the day before. Yet the next day it was like our conversation did not happen, and she said we had to pay $50 to check in early."", 'Sara‚Äôs place is clean and comfortable, but you must know ahead of time what you are getting into. It‚Äôs on the 4th floor and there‚Äôs no elevator. It is also a few feet away from a very active train line, which is noisy at all times of the day. We knew this ahead of time and could tolerate it, but that may be a dealbreaker for most people.\nWe also had an issue with the iron not working but Sara did replace that. Please note that if you plan on ‚Äúhanging out‚Äù in the apartment, there is no true ‚Äúcouch‚Äù or comfortable lounge area.\nTowels, mattress, and water pressure were all below average.

Bedrooms are comfy with modern, king beds. Bathroom has almost entirely original finishes/fixtures and is in great shape. I loved it as a restoration nerd, but it was also plenty spacious for the 2 of us. Having the garage to park in made life so easy. We high-fived each other every night on our decision to NOT stay in the city. One note - bring portable blackout curtains if you need to sleep late or put a kiddo down for a nap.

We arrived and everything looked like the photos. There were ants on the kitchen floor, the kitchen chairs were extremely uncomfortable and looked like they hadn‚Äôt been cleaned in awhile. I had to work during the stay & anytime I moved in the chair, the top came off. The kitchen had no light. So I moved the desk next to couch. Upon taking a shower, we noticed mold / black spots throughout the shower that made us uneasy. I explained this to Mark and he was willing to refund and allow us to check out. Unfortunately, it was already late and that left us needing to find immediate accommodations last minute. Which is difficult. Airbnb ended up cancelling our stay and we left immediately (before moving the table back to its original location), which prompted Mark to message me asking why we ‚Äúmoved the furniture all over the place‚Äù. Which I felt was inappropriate due to his Airbnb not being ready for guests but available to book.', ""Mark's place is a perfect if you're looking for something close to the Blue Line in a quieter part of a Chicago neighborhood.

We didn\'t cook (though we could have, considering how well-stocked the kitchen is with pots, pans, spices, etc.), but we ordered in food a couple of times and ate outside on the lovely, covered back porch. It was so quiet and peaceful! My daughter and her boyfriend had to work remotely for a few hours, which was easy enough given the large kitchen island and the comfy bar stools. Kim is truly an amazing host, and always responded quickly. Given that my daughter was arriving earlier than me, she was kind enough to allow us an early check-in, and a late check-out so they could work for a couple of hours on Monday.', 'Kim was a wonderful host.

It matched the description and photos, and the instructions for check in and check out were very clearly communicated. I would stay here again and would recommend it if you're looking for a place in this neighborhood."", 'Cute garden apartment in a fun neighborhood! I loved the easy access to the EL and local restaurants. The check in had very detailed directions, and checkout was literally the easiest I‚Äôve ever had at an AirBnB. (You just lock the door and return the key to the lock box!)\nGiven that it‚Äôs a garden apartment, if you‚Äôre a single woman traveling here, you‚Äôll want to keep the windows locked and the blinds closed for privacy/security.\nVery clean unit and really appreciated the filtered water and the oatmeal packets! It is an older building, so you have a lot of charm to the place.\nBe warned: Street parking is non-existent. But if you use SpotHero, there are plenty of spots to rent for about $10 a day.\nWould absolutely stay here again!', 'Thank you!', ""David's place was similar to the photos and clean. The real plus is the neighborhood which is very nice with many cafes. The metro is easily accessible on foot and the lake is about 2 km away. One downside, the street is very busy and therefore noisy.\nThe host was very responsive."", ""Location, wifi, and amenities are perfect. The apartment is even better than the photos. Traffic noise is considerable at night if you're a sensitive sleeper. Overall, my stay in Chicago was awesome. Thank you!"", 'Small but cozy, well-designed and well-equipped place. Location is great. Grocery store, restaurants, shopping within a short walking distance. Having the keurig was a lifesaver.

Hosts are amazing and very communicative. Would stay here again!', 'David‚Äôs place was very well equipped and nicely decorated! He gave us a great tip to use ‚Äúpark spot‚Äù for parking around the neighborhood, which was super useful. The apartment is spacious, and I loved the bathroom. It is located by the street, but since it‚Äôs mostly a residential neighborhood that wasn‚Äôt a disturbance. Would highly recommend!', 'Great location, we enjoyed our stay here. The team was very responsive.', 'We had a wonderful 3 day stay, the place totally met our expectations and we enjoyed the neighborhood shops, restaurants and of course Wrigley Field. Highly recommend this spot! We will be back', 'The place itself was nice and comfortable. David and his team responds promptly to any request. The spot had sodas, water, coffee, oatmeal and popsicles in the freezer, which I thought was pretty dope. I did suggest to David adding food trays and a regular size ironing board. Hopefully he gets those amenities in there soon. Good food spots in the area. I know in the description it is suggested that you might want to use SpotHero for parking, but parking is by permit only at night on 99% of the streets in the area so you should definitely use SpotHero. My first night was a mess because I wasn\'t aware of the permit parking and I wouldn\'t want you to deal with that. Make sure you read the rules before you purchase a SpotHero though, some of them don\'t allow in & out access which doesn\'t work if you\'re staying for a few days. Lastly, the neighborhood is 99% white and if you are a person of color, you will definitely feel that ""energy"". That\'s not a knock on David or his service, but I think it\'s important to know.', 'David‚Äôs apartment is street level but feels quite private. There is no train noise at all, just some city-street noise, not enough to disturb our sleep. The place is quite clean and fresh. I loved the Britta water tank in the fridge. The bed was quite comfortable, as was the sofa. David and his co-hosts were incredibly responsive and accommodating to a few requests that we had. I love that there is a laundry room in the back with many machines, i.e., no waiting!

The flat is very comfortable, with a large and steady bed and a soft couch. There is a television and a large closet to put clothes in. As other guests have noted, the lack of a dinner table and the apartment's position next to the sidewalk take some time to get used to, but are by no means serious issues. Finally, the location of the flat is terrific. There are 3 metro stops within walking distance, and the many bars, restaurants and shops of Wrigleyville are only a short walk away.

It is everything it was stated to be - clean, very well-appointed, and convenient to Wrigley Field and the L (Brown and Red train lines nearby) and bus routes.\nWhat would I like others to know: it‚Äôs an older building, so the water pressure is not great. It‚Äôs a garden level (semi-basement) apartment, so you may need the blinds closed for your desired level of privacy.

We didn't visit The Metropolitan. One thing to be aware of is that the owner has a device in the unit to monitor noise level.\nThe downsides: some traffic noise (might be more noise in other seasons), no dining table, not a good setup to watch TV (the bed style blocked view from bed, can't see TV from sofa), no shelf in bathroom for your toiletries.\nThe positives definitely outweighed the downsides and I'd definitely stay again on a future visit!"", 'This was a wonderful place to stay.

It is probably 6 inches wide by 3 inches tall and runs the length of the living room. They have clearly done what they can to minimize issues related to this. The furniture is placed in a manner that appears as safe as possible. Unfortunately, my two year old tripped while I was feeding our one year old and flew a bit and hit his mouth against the metal bar at the bottom of one of the barstools and has a mouth laceration and a slightly loose tooth.

Take pink line train (loop) to downtown and make sure to get Ventra Card or use the app on your phone and scan it with your Apple or Google Pay\n2.) Be prepared to walk a lot.

Awesome!', ""This was our second stay in the area, first stay at Michael's place. Let me just say, that dedicated parking space is an absolute treasure. The location was great.

No‚Äîbut I didn\'t expect it to be.\nTo be clear, we had a totally satisfactory stay at Michael\'s place. We brought our nephew to Chicago for a graduation trip, and wanted to be somewhere convenient and relatively inexpensive. The apartment was great as a basic home base / place to sleep, and was a fine place to work from home for a day. I\'d recommended it wholeheartedly if that\'s all you need. It was clearly a rental property, furnished with mostly Target furniture and supplies, and a bit dark‚Äîbut I expected all that coming into it, so none of this is a complaint.\nThe neighborhood is super walkable, a few blocks from the Armitage L stop, right around the corner from tons of shopping, and about half a mile to the lake.', ""The place was absolutely the best. Micheal's place had everything you could possibly need right down to an extra toothbrush. There were plenty of eating, shopping and bars within walking distance.

We look forward to renting from Michael again in the future, and highly recommend this location!', 'We had a wonderful stay at Michael‚Äôs place. We loved that he had a pack and play and a high chair for my son. The location is in a beautiful neighborhood with lots of great restaurants around. Michael checked in often to see if we needed anything and gave lots of recommendations. When I asked if there was outdoor furniture like there had been in the photos, he had his property manager get the furniture and set it up within an hour (it has snowed a few days before which is why it wasn‚Äôt set up). We would highly recommend staying here!', ""First off, Michael is a very proactive and friendly host - he was quick to respond and provided clear instructions on how to get in and leave the place.\nSecond, the location and setup of this place is wonderful!

As former Chicago residents, the location was prime, easy to get to and very centrally located to all our favorite spots! It was a perfect pied-a-terre when we were back home.
