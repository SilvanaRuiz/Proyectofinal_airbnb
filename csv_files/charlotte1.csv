Charlotte has a real problem with homelessness and there were people around the building sleeping. Second, the beautiful top to bottom windows are great during the day but at night create a real problem with noise, Saturday night sounded like we were at Charlotte Motor Speedway until about 3am with people racing by. Woke me and my wife up multiple times. Last, the building had some sort of issue with the pipes banging that next night (Sunday) from about 11pm to 2am, it sounds like it was banging right behind the headboard to our bed. Not ideal under normal circumstances but we were in town for my wife to take a very important exam and would’ve benefitted from a better nights sleep', ""The apartment was clean and cozy.

There was an issue with the door jamming and not properly being secure and I don’t understand why this hasn’t been fixed considering I’ve seen it on quite a few reviews. Also they have a noise and smoking monitor in the apartment which that isn’t listed on the listing just told to you after you book! I think all rules should be listed prior to booking so you are fully aware of what you’re booking. They told us about a noise monitor and no smoking on the property at all rule after booking and two days before our trip! Not a problem for us because we aren’t smokers but if I was I’d liked to know that I cannot smoke anywhere on this property prior to booking.

Upon arrival, we encountered several issues, including stained throw pillows on the bed and a dirty refrigerator. Additionally, someone entered the 1st floor after 9 pm, in violation of the stated no-interruptions-after-9 pm rule. To make matters worse, the back entrance gate was obstructed by an RV/trailer, and there was inadequate lighting to locate the latch. The walkway to the front door was covered in slippery leaves, creating a safety hazard. Large piles of dog poop marred the grass in front of the Airbnb entrance. On the last day, we requested to leave early due to these issues, but we were informed that it went against the cancellation policy, which required a 5-day notice for cancellation.

It’s out back and you have to walk from the road down the driveway and squeeze between a truck and the porch and go through a gate with all your stuff which was hard.\nAlso, the heating/ air was in Celsius and the remote was confusing and it was hard to figure out.

House itself was old/in need of renovation. Obvious owners tried their best to make it nice/decorated it well which I appreciated. Neighborhood was also a bit run down but felt safe enough. Cleaning could’ve been a bit better, there was hair in the tub and it smelled like not all linens/pillow cases on the bed were cleaned. Overall, stay was good especially for the price.', 'I recently stayed at this Airbnb and had a wonderful experience. The property was just as described in the listing—clean, comfortable, and well-equipped with everything we needed for a relaxing stay.

I look forward to returning in the future!', 'Ruben’s place was perfect for our weekend stay.', ""We enjoyed our stay in Charlotte! The home is close to NODA (North Davidson), which has fun art, restaurants, and a welcoming vibe. The distance to NODA is walkable (a longer walk, but not unreasonable), and there is convenient access to the light rail, which will get you to NODA and beyond. We did not have a car, and I didn't feel like we needed one. I appreciated the stocked Keurig and granola when I was running late in the morning. There is also good coffee, beer, a distillery, and a noodle house within walking distance. The neighborhood is quiet, and the home has a small bonus room in the back that works well for Zoom calls. Check-in was easy, and Ruben was friendly."", ""Had a great time at Ruben's place! My wife & I were visiting CLT for the first time and really enjoyed our stay. The location is literally a 2min walk from Sugar Creek station, which you can hop on and explore NODA in just a few stops (this was a major perk for us as we took the lightrail for everything in uptown). Driving wise it seemed like we were never more than 20 min away from anything. Quiet neighborhood with nice neighbors as well. Would definitely recommend!"", 'Ruben is a great host, super responsive!

They also included a sound machine in each room which is my travel love language for a good night’s sleep! Quiet neighborhood and could easily get to NoDa area and around town from this location.', 'This is a nice private place with tv, WiFi, parking, full kitchen, etc. Very close to the NoDa restaurants and easy to use as a starting point to explore the city. Yes, the trains go by occasionally but it is absolutely not a problem. The noise from that is insignificant. Ruben communicated well, and he made sure I could contact him at any time. I would recommend this property and would definitely consider staying there again on my next trip to Charlotte.', 'Beautiful home. I felt safe and the home was clean.', 'Sweet little space in a good location for a great price. The beds were comfortable too.', 'Ruben was highly communicative and that made the stay a breeze. Easy access in and out. WiFi dipped at one point and Ruben was both communicative and got an ATT person over to fix it as soon as possible without us asking first. Great and helpful host.', 'Enjoyed staying at Ruben’s place. Comfortable bed and good location. I would stay here again.', ""Ruben was very responsive and friendly. We had an issue of having no power upon arrival due to a power outage which was very inconvenient but understand that it out of Ruben's control. The house is older with fresh paint so it appears to be nice but there are minor imperfections. This did not completely ruin the trip for us. I really wish there was a bigger mirror in the bathroom since you can only see your face and nothing else because it is mounted so high and it is a slender mirror. Overall a decent stay, just a very unfortunate start."", 'Ruben was a wonderful host and the stay was excellent. He was very understanding of our needs and we were well accommodated. The place was perfect for us.', 'Clean, comfortable, close to great restaurants.

Fantastic host would totally recommend to friends and family.', ""My sister and I traveled to Charlotte for a short visit, and this house made us feel right at home.

The neighborhood was quiet and the home was exactly what we needed for our weekend away.', ""Host was very communicable and sent clear instructions every step of the way - warning us preemptively of things to be aware of like the door sticking a little and the backyard being closed off. Check in/out times were reasonable and the clean up required from us was kept simple.\nThis location was great! It's located in a quiet little neighborhood a very short walk under the bridge to the Light Rail which can then be ridden to several areas of Charlotte (the closest being NoDa). The place was very tidy and quaint - it shows a little age and is definitely an older house that has been renovated but I found it very charming.\nThe décor choices were super cute. The beds and linens were comfortable. AC/Heating was modern and parking was on site. Only small complaint was the bathroom was a little small and cramped. All and all a very lovely gem to find and I'd definitely love to return again one day and stay here while exploring other areas of Charlotte!"", 'This place was exactly as described and seen in photos.\nIt is a very short drive to a hip little area that work for dates, families, or groups of get togethers!', 'We very much enjoyed our stay with Ruben.

Convenient to everything! Thanks for a great stay!!', ""Ruben's space was very nice, everything as pictured and spotlessly clean for our arrival. I would note that the only coffee equipment that is available is a Keurig. We were glad that one of our traveling group had noticed there wasn't a drip coffee maker and brought one along as we prefer being able to make a pot of our own roast. No one in our group had issue with the nearby trains and the location really is great for both driving to other Charlotte attractions or for a good walk around the neighborhood or over to the heart of NODA for food and fun. We caught a street market in progress one of the days we were there which was super cool!"", 'We absolutely loved staying here, this house was so clean and nicely decorated!

It was beautifully decorated and smelled amazing inside. Very close to what we were doing and not far from the city.

Other than that didn’t communicate much, didn’t have to :) but super friendly and would stay again. Not a downfall at all but the bathroom was smaller than expected. Check in and check out was probably one of the easiest!', ""The house itself was nice, but our favorite part was the close proximity to the light rail station! It was so easy to walk down to the station and take the train to the Spectrum Center.\nThe road the house is on felt fairly quiet and safe. It's kind of a one-off street, so we weren't worried about random people walking by or anything like that.\nThe house was clean, and the beds were comfortable. We appreciated the sound machines in the bedrooms, as I am a very light sleeper.

He had some great recommendations for things in the area as well. The only thing that my group and I found to be a slight downside to our stay would be the floors.

The cottage is similar to a 1 room studio with bed tv and kitchen all in one space and the bathroom separated with a sliding door. It was perfect for my mom. You are right across from the lake and can enjoy some amazing morning/evening views and walks. Bring some bug spray and sunblock as the mosquitos and sun can be brutal.\nYou are 10 minutes from everything you need. You have Publix grocery store as the closest but a Walmart not far away. I found Hope Park less then 10 minutes away that allowed for my daughter to enjoy a park with a water pad all free. Behind the park was a Fresh produce market. I have a kayak and innertubes that I brought on our last day and was able to float and navigate the channel. We got to see a flock of geese, fish jumping out of the water, and enjoy the warm water.\nI know if my mom wants to come out again she will be looking for this to be opened or at least something similar. I can only hope it would be as nice as this.', 'Andreas cottage is a great spot for a weekend getaway and she is a perfect host.

Cabinets in the kitchen were empty and a small landing zone next to the front door was open for all of MY things! My dog is super clingy, so having one space was perfect for him to relax and not have to follow me. I could have made room for workouts if I pushed the couch aside, but there was so much room in the private and fenced yard, I blasted my music and worked outside.\nSingle ladies: I felt very safe and looked out for here. The neighborhood was safe and quiet at night. I had no worries walking my dog any time of day or night. I was also included in neighborhood get togethers and introduced to all the neighbors.

We had our 37 foot class A and both work remote. Having an extra place to work with AC for the week was so helpful!! Talk to Andrea about electricity costs to plug in. It’ll be worth it. The drive in to her neighborhood has a few spots with lower branches on one side of the street but you can avoid by going around. The gravel drive is wide enough to accommodate slides and long enough to put a car behind (and maybe alongside). It is sloped a bit but we managed. Large trees on one side keep it shaded.\nPlenty of restaurants and stores all within 5-10 min drive. We love Eddie’s outdoor bar and the people there are always nice.\nRent a pontoon from Jeff and be sure to go up to Toucans or Blue Parrot.', 'Andrea was super responsive when we had questions and helped us feel right at home.\nShe gave us local info that was really fun, and had events for us to participate in.\nSuper private, fenced in for the dogs and easy to clean (important cause we were there for two months!)\nGreat, safe neighborhood.

Even though the cottage is smaller, we were able to very comfortably live and relax during our 4 week stay. Our dog loved the fenced-in area and also made some new friends in the neighborhood!\nAndrea is the best when it comes to hosting. She gave us ideas on things to do and places to go. Since our visit was a house-hunting trip, she made a point to introduce us to people in the neighborhood, who are all extremely nice.

Overall, we enjoyed our stay - the host was communicative, the place was clean and cozy.\nI'm knocking off a star for a couple of easily fixable reasons:\n- The shower is super nice but the provided shampoo/conditioner is kinda cheap stuff. Felt kinda like putting cheap oil in a Ferrari.\n- The hair dryer doesn't work very well.\n- Checkout at 10am is a bit early when most places ask for checkout at 11am. Especially not great if you're not morning people or if you're staying for a late night concert or anything like that.\nAgain though, overall a solid place to stay and those are easy improvements."", 'Ranin was a helpful host. His property is very accurately described as a small space with tons of fun, a nice bed, and gorgeous bathroom. He offered us nicely to visit south park mall, which was a nice recommendation.

Both were exceptionally soothing.', 'Great setting for a night or two and close to the city. At times difficult to understand instructions/emails (seemed to be missing words in sentences or wrong structure). Place was spotless and provided items were easy to find. Brewery and a few activities within walking distance, but definitely would need to drive or Uber to more ""active"" areas.\nWhile the apartment was clean, it had a musty (almost) moldy scent to it, predominantly in the bathroom. I have a super sniffer and my husband could barely smell it. We also enjoyed the rooftop patio, while it was hot, it was nice for a night cap.\nWarning: If you have a low clearance car, you will have difficulty getting in and out of the drive due to the grade down to the parking space.

The airbnb was exactly as it was listed and was super clean and cozy. We asked if they had an HDMI cord and they went out of their way to search for one for us. The only reason I had to give a 4 star rating is because unfortunately, my car was stolen. We believe it was The Kia Boys because of the way it was stolen, wrecked and abandoned. We spoke with Ruben and he was shocked and expressed that nothing like this has ever happened in their neighborhood before. I believe him, as the neighborhood did feel very safe, quiet and well maintained. I just felt like I should say something so everyone is aware and takes the proper precautions.', 'Very good place to stay!! Super cute!']",['3 guests · 1 bedroom · 2 beds · 1 bath']

Those bambo blinds were complete see through at night, especially if you have the lights on. Since it's butting a backyard of adjacent houses they can definitely see through.

Cute spot in a very suburban area. It was a perfect spot for our little trip. Would stay there again.', 'Very cute place! We enjoyed the location, especially walking to restaurants and coffee shops. Is very peaceful and although we parked on the street, there’s an area specifically for the guests that makes it a lot better to park. The bed was comfortable!\nJust a few critiques: the shower is small and awkward especially for tall/heavier body types, the hot/cold water is tricky to regulate, I didn’t enjoy stepping on the stool to use the microwave,and the blinds can use blackout curtains to help with light and privacy.', 'Oh my gosh, this was a like a little magic retreat house. All the sweet nooks and crannies of this place made it so unique!! The garden was gorgeous (even in the winter with its twinkling lights), the neighborhood was awesome to walk (be sure to walk to MilkBread, you will love it!) and the bed was super comfy. We had everything we needed and then some. Oh!! The HVAC units make a low noise/vibration when they are fully running... it sounds like a truck idling down the block a bit. It will NOT bother you once you know what it is, but you will wonder what it is when you first hear it!! We hope to be back again, thank you Scott!!', 'Great place to stay with plenty of room for a small space. Very walkable to restaurants, cafes, and a large Harris Teeter to get groceries.

Thank you so much.', 'BE WARE! VERY VERY DANGEROUS AIR BNB TO STAY AT.\nAt first our stay was your average Airbnb stay, clean, beautiful house, no problems. However on our last night there at 4am two individuals came into the house while we were sleeping and used the code the host provided to them. They were meant to stay in the air bnb later that day but since they were given the code they drunkingly came into our air bnb DEMANDING we share the space. They had no luggage and arrived on foot. After begging them to please leave and they realized they shouldn’t have been there they left. HOWEVER they were loitering outside the property on the patio doing who knows what at 4am!!! We were left completely terrified and shaken up. Police had to be called to assist in this situation. Once we had let the “Superhost” aware of what was happening. He begged us to not leave a bad review. Absolutely maddening and will never be using airbnb again. My friends and I are left\ntraumatized.', ""I'm a Charlotte native who moved away in '92 - and the city is largely unrecognizable to me now. That said, I'm familiar with the neighborhoods, and I was thrilled to see beautiful Plaza Midwood retained it's charm! The guesthouse is lovely and in a perfect location (convenient to everything!) All details - the reserved parking spots, the private gate entrance, the vintage decor, the perfect kitchen, comfy bed - were all thought out. There really wasn't any detail missing, all my possible needs had been considered. I truly felt at home in my hometown! The mini-split air units were cranking through 98 degree heat and I only needed to run one - and even when set to 75, it was COLD! So efficient; I kept it on 77.\nThere had to be something, and that is only that the shower takes fiddling. The knobs point in two directions and it's very easy to go from scalding to freezing with a microadjustment. This was a bit annoying, but everything else was so perfect, I'll be back! Thanks, Scott!"", 'Enjoyed our stay here! The location is excellent, perfect for walking and running. The place is unique and has some quirks but that also gives it a lot of character (for example the bathroom is the center of the house. To get to the kitchen from the bedroom you must go through the bathroom. There are also 5+ light switches per room and all in odd places so was often hard to find which turned on what. We stayed for 10 days and were never able to quite master it.). I think it’s an excellent place to stay for a couple, but would be hard for any group bigger than 2 especially given the bathroom situation. Would also avoid if you have difficulties getting around as the bathroom is very small and getting out of the shower always felt a little unsafe. But we were fine and never had any issues. The brita filter was a nice touch! Scott was also excellent with communication.', 'Such a lovely cute place!!', 'Will definitely stay at the rosebud again !!!

Everything was clean, well organized, and decorated nicely. The space felt comfortable and safe and we slept well in the comfortable bed. I’d not necessarily recommend for more than two people as the only real negatives are the slightly cramped shower and centralized bathroom leaving little privacy. This cottage is right behind the main guesthouse where our friends were staying but it may have been odd or noisy if that space was occupied by strangers as the main deck is steps away from your bedroom. Overall we we are very happy with the stay and the host was responsive and very communicative with recommendations and check in/out instructions.

She was very friendly and helpful and it was a comfortable, clean place to stay. The tap in the bathtub was dripping so that was kind of annoying and I would have appreciated a kettle to boil water. The pots and pans are very old, scratched up teflon so I couldn't use them either. The curtain rod between the living area and the bedroom fell down and was broken so we couldn't put it back up. With a few tweaks, this would be a very nice place to stay for a short time.

Other than that everything was great."", 'Very nice place to stay.', 'very cool space and host! highly recommend!', 'Carson provided good shelter after the storm, literally after hurricane Helene hit Asheville where I had been staying when it hit. Was so glad to have safety, shelter, electricity and good wifi not to mention a hot shower and bottled water.\nCarson’s place is eclectic, artistic, funky in a good way, clean and comfortable. He is an effective communicator with good working and organization systems for his guests to share a co-living space. I was reluctant to share a bathroom however it turned out to not be an issue and the benefits of his place far out weighed the cons.\nAlthough Carson provides white noise for the rooms near the busy road you will want earplugs if you are sensitive to noise otherwise the back bedroom of the house is the best choice for more quiet and the best mattress for comfort.\nCarson’s assistance. recommendations and accommodations during a very stressful transition were a Godsend for me. Would definitely stay at his place again.']",['1 double bed · Shared bathroom']

We were in a walkable distance to many shops and restaurants. Easy parking at the complex. Communication was great!', ""I had a generally positive stay at this apartment - it's in a great, central location and was very clean and comfortable. The host was incredibly responsive and communicated well throughout our stay, which I really appreciated.\nHowever, a couple of things to be aware of: the apartment is on the 2nd floor facing a busy road, so you can hear traffic pretty much at all hours. The walls are also quite thin, so if you're a light sleeper, this might be an issue. Additionally, there's a 7-Eleven right across the street, and the bright lights do shine into the apartment at night, which might be bothersome if you're sensitive to light.\nOverall, it's a good spot if you're looking for convenience and don't mind the noise and light, but if you're someone who needs a quiet, dark space to sleep or for work, it might not be the best fit."", 'Great place in a great area!

The apartment it’s not clean, the couch it’s stained, the walls are stained, we washed the bed sheets cause everything else was so dirty that we didn’t trusted them, plus they smell funky.

Wonderful price to have a place to lay my head and my own bathroom for a night!"", 'Clean and friendly! Great stay!', 'We greatly enjoyed our stay at Ken’s home. He was welcoming and accommodating of our late arrival. The dogs are such furry loves and the cat was sweet and affectionate. If you love animals, you will be thrilled with excited puppy kisses and “hugs.” Make sure you follow Ken’s instructions and allow him to introduce you to the dogs as they take a few minutes to lose their exuberance. They need a few moments to get used to you—totally understandable. The bedroom itself was clean and comfortable, the bathroom was roomy and clean with shampoo, conditioner, and body wash provided; and the check-in instructions were clear and easy to follow.

Bonus, an affectionate kitty!', ""This was our first time staying at an AirBnB so we were counting on the listing and reviews to be accurate. We chose Ken's place because we wanted a close & easy getaway for a few days. He's a very nice man, friendly, genuinely seems to like meeting new people. The reviews for the Zen Room were great, mostly about how friendly the animals were so we were looking forward to some cat & dog snuggles. What they didn't say was that you can't get close to the dogs without them jumping on you first. The reviews also didn't mention that we'd be woken up both nights (in the middle of the night) by Cheeto the cat trying to pry his way into our room. Not Zen. The full size bed (its absolutely not a queen) was really uncomfortable BUT the linens were super soft. It's a beautiful, safe neighborhood at a great price for a quick night's stay, but we didn't find it relaxing at all."", 'Ken’s place is very comfortable.

You’ll just have to resist the urge to bring Cheeto home with you!', ""Ken's home is beautiful. It's in a very quiet neighborhood. It is sparkling clean. We mentioned that we drink coffee they didn't have any regular coffee so they brought out the coffee maker just for us. Went out to the store bought some coffee and creamer so we could have coffee in the early morning before we left. He has 2 amazing dogs & 2 amazing cats. They are all very friendly. I certainly know why he is a superhost. We will definitely stay with him again."", 'I couldn’t stay at Ken’s place due to a last minute unexpected change of plans, but Ken was great in his communication leading up to my planned stay.', ""Ken's place is extremely gorgeous. He was nice, welcoming and very accommodating. I love the fact that he actually held a conversation vs just showing me where my room is. I felt like I was appreciated. The bed is very comfortable as well. As a matter of fact, I think it was too comfortable because I slept longer than expected vs getting up early to work on my project. I truly recommend his place."", 'Great place', 'Stayed here for 2 and a half months. Ken is very nice and his house is located in a beautiful safe area. He respects his guest space and will interact with you as much as you want him to. Sometimes the dogs will bark at night, but if you text/tell Ken about it he will make sure the dogs are quiet. Overall good stay!', 'Ken is a fantastic host and great person all around. The stay was much better than I expected. The bedroom itself is peaceful and tranquil - a perfect place to relax. I found Ken to be an extremely accommodating host. I asked a few favors of him during my stay and he was always willing to accommodate. We had some interesting conversations as well. Ken is a professor and is very well read, so it was a lot of fun having discussions with him. Thank you again Ken!!!', 'I stayed for 5 weeks at Ken’s house. Overall I had a great stay and enjoyed my time there. Ken is very helpful and willing to work around move in and out times. Occasionally he may have guests over. The pets are very friendly, especially the dogs.', ""I had an amazing stay at Ken's place. The home and room was gorgeous and clean. Ken's pets were adorable and friendly. If I'm in the area again, I definitely hope Ken's place is available."", 'This was our second stay at Ken’s place. Ken was very helpful with recommendations of local restaurants; and we enjoyed seeing his friendly cats again. We would definitely come back again.', 'This is indeed a Zen spot surrounded by trees and nature yet not far from restaurants and social activities. Ken is a gracious host, along with his loving side kick, Cheeto the cat, who will greet you at the door and show you around 😀 I love animals, so spending time with Jackson, Gage, Zena, and of course, Cheeto was a part of my relaxation 😌 All was as advertised and I would definitely return!']",['1 queen bed · Dedicated bathroom']

We were visiting friends that live in Matthew’s and the house was perfect for us. We loved the proximity to town restaurants and pubs and local bike paths. We used Four Mile Creek greenway (rode bikes directly there, less than a mile away) and Sugar Creek Greenway about 15 minutes away by car in Pineville.\nThere is a beautiful covered front porch that we enjoyed at all hours. Coffee in the morning, reading in the afternoon and wine in evening.\nWe had our own chairs so if you drive bring some so you can enjoy the porch.\nWe especially loved that there were paper products, personal beauty products and cleaning products available in bathroom, kitchen and utility room. This helped us keep the home tidy during our stay.\nThere were plenty of bath towels, wash clothes, hand towels and kitchen towels which is a bonus as well.\nThank you for making everything so perfect!', 'We had a peaceful week-long stay at the cabin. It was right on theme, with black and white stylish details everywhere. The hosts were very responsive. They provided an iron and a board that were not initially available because some of my clothes were wrinkled during my flight. The place was clutter free and smelled clean. The bathroom, kitchen and other surfaces were clean, floor looked clean but was dusty, perhaps from the place being empty for a while. The host sent a person to clean again the following day. Kitchen and laundry appliances were functional and convenient. The shower had hot water and good pressure. It was a lovely cabin.', 'Tiny home. Perfect little getaway. The town is such a great little spot. The house is tucked in the woods, a little solace.', 'House was super cute and perfect for our one night stay.', 'The Black & White cabin was such a lovely place to stay!

The home was impeccably clean and comfortable and so tastefully decorated—a combination of mid-century modern decor mixed with antiques. I was impressed with all the thoughtful details throughout. In particular, I loved the soft linens used on the beds, the exposed brick in the bathroom, and the string lights in the backyard, which provided a lot of ambiance for sitting around the firepit. We cooked both nights of our stay—the kitchen was stocked with all the cookware, utensils, tableware, etc. that we needed. The house is also within a short walk to the downtown area, which was a nice plus for grabbing lunch out. Colleen was an excellent communicator before, during, and after our stay.

I used to frequent this side of town as a teen, and I was surprised by the amount of growth in this location. This is a great location for people who want to be outside the Charlotte epicenter but still have access to restaurants and local shopping. The home's interior has a cool conservatory appeal, and the placement of windows and mirrors allows you to appreciate North Carolina's beautiful trees and neighborhood wildlife (squirrels, rabbits, and birds). We enjoyed the hot tube and firepit when our little one went to sleep or took a nap. Those little moments were a great Christmas gift for Mom and Dad. The beds were some of the most comfortable I've ever slept in. We took lots of naps.

Colleen was an excellent host, and the home was everything we needed. Highly recommend! 😊', 'Overall we were happy with the listing. Clearly some thought and energy went into making this a more luxurious Airbnb, but some points were missed. Due to the remodel of the home, there are a lot of uneven areas in the floor throughout the house and at the back door. Some of the renovation aspects seem a bit rushed and led to a couple of janky things. There are a lot of new homes being built on the street which led to daily construction noise which made it a less relaxing listing. We were ultimately happy with the space but did feel that it was overpriced compared with other offerings in the city.', 'Enjoyed this Colleen’s home so much!

Perfection and worthy of a rating of 6 on a scale of 1-5! Hope to secure this again for a future visit! Thank you!', 'We have looked at this place a few times and the stars never aligned. Well let me tell you the stars aligned and it was worth it, 10-10 stars are not enough by any means! From the hot tub to watching the chipmunks in the back yard, the great selection of restaurants, I mean just everything was on point and 150% spot on.\nEven though we live in Indian Trail, NC and only 15 mins from this place I can say with utmost certainty we will want to come back for another staycation :).

I did NOT think this would be around our area—a clean location nestled in a quiet neighborhood. When I looked at the address of the home, I wondered how ""busy"" the area would be like, but it was VERY quiet! The outdoor hot tub was also nice, and with the bubbles rolling and the fan circulating, you didn\'t hear any vehicle driving by. The heated bathroom floor added some extra flare along with the other ""upgraded"" items in the bathroom. The home was trendy and felt very much like a home away from home.

Yes, the host describes the A/C unit noise and does provide earplugs, but I went 2 nights with very little sleep due to the loud slamming bang of the AC unit (when it kicks on) and noise of it running that follows. It's unlike anything I have ever experienced at a rental before.\nThe space was clean and had super quirky décor. The bed was massive and the mattress was comfortable.\nI think the host is in between a rock and hard place. The AC unit is for the whole building (multiple restaurants and flats) and it just happens to be directly above the bedroom in this unit.\nOverall it's not the hosts fault, but potential renters should be aware of the issue at hand."", 'Easy to find and a great stay!

Quinsia called me the next day regarding the ice maker and upon me asking if she got my message, she said no and said she’d look into it and that was it. The TV also did not work because it would not connect to the WiFi.

To check in, you must park on the front of side of building, enter code and get buzzed in, go to 4th floor of parking garage through the condo building, get a key from a lock box, go back into the building and into the condo, get the parking fob out of the apartment, go back out to your car, drive your car into the garage, and then come into the condo to get settled. I understand there may not be an alternative, but it was tedious and time consuming and I wish I knew to expect it.\nComfortable bed, nice kitchen, access to gym when another resident let me in (fob didn’t work), decent location.

Same with creaky floorboards; totally normal in an older home like this, but we could feel the neighbors walking, and I\'m sure vice versa. Other than that, we felt a little cramped. Small nightstands, nowhere to put ""stuff"" in the bathroom, no place to get ready (most ladies need a hair/makeup spot), just a small loveseat and not a full couch.

I’d definitely stay here again. The place was SPOTLESS! It’s in the middle of everything so even if you don’t rent a car, you could still Uber (Uber’s were super cheap) or use public transportation.

I loved your apartment!"", ""My wife and I stayed at Tracy's place in Jan. 2024 & we really liked the 'feel' of the place. It is stylish and has the feel of a renovated industrial loft. The lighting and decorations are slick and modern —the vibe is that of a club or bar. Everything is clean and well appointed, the building's location is industrial-transitioning-to-residential.\nFull disclosure: we would not stay there again because neither of us slept well; while the the mattress is nice (but the polyester sleets don't breathe). Our main issue was with the busy road >>just 30' from the bed<< —— road noise is frequent. Ear plugs ARE provided, but if you are accoustomed to sleeping in a dark place you might want to bring an eye-shade too; the curtains don't cover all of the giant windows and are there a lots of streetlights just outside the glass, so the unit is in perpetual dawn."", 'Loved our stay! The space was exactly as pictured in the listing, but somehow even cuter. The bed was so comfortable and we really appreciated all the extra blankets and pillow options. Tracy was super communicative and was also kind enough to allow a flexible/earlier check in time. The fully stocked coffee bar was also great!\nPay attention to the listing, there is only ONE parking spot, so if you have more than 1 vehicle I’m sure Tracy may have suggestions on additional parking options- we didn’t see any public parking options nearby.\nVery easily accessible for Uber/Lyft.

The spacious en suite room is exceptionally private. A large closet gives plenty of storage for longer stays. Comfortable bed. Shower is great, roomy with rain showerhead. I am Dan's wife writing this review; I would feel perfectly safe staying here as solo woman traveler. Chuck's home has a full alarm system. The biggest problem we had, which Chuck has absolutely no control over, was the overnight roadwork. Flashing police lights, huge spotlights, shouting workers, and even a pile driver from 10 pm to 6 am. This is a temporary problem but we got very little sleep. When the roadwork is finished, I think it is fairly quiet, with only usual road noise. We would definitely stay again after the roadwork is over."", ""Man Listen, Chuck is an excellent Host\nHe is proactively responsive, clear instructions, squeaky clean scenery and linen, comfortable bed, programmed smart TV plus charger outlet provided. The unique marble shower is just as soothing as it is impressive. I like how the room had a wooden standup tray for me to sit down on the chair in the room and enjoy my meal.
