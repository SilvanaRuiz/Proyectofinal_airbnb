The host is communicative and thoughtful.', 'My stay at Sebastien\'s was okay. This is the third property that I rented in Miraflores, and I always look for 2 things that are very important to me:. hot water in all faucets and laundry (washer and drier) in the apartment...therefore, I pay a little extra compared to other properties in the same neighborhood. First, we had a problem with the door of the washer/drier (single unit); it wouldn\'t open, so we called to get help; it took a while and a call to many people to get help with it. So finally, we got it opened...very hard to open, but we got it ""fixed"". Then, the drier wouldn\'t dry the clothes; the drying cycle would stop afer 15-20 minutes into it...it took more than a entire day to get a load of clothes ""dry""...we had to lay the clothes flat on the bed or on the stairs rails to finish drying the clothes; the area heater helped with it. Sebastien suggested taking it to the laundry, but didn\'t offer to pay for it for the inconvenience of not having a working drier as advertised in his ad.\nThe apartment only has one TV, and it was on the first floor. It was a bit inconvenient for us as we travel with a little kid...we had to watch kid\'s shows most of the time when we were in the apartment. Another inconvenience was the layout of the apartment; the 2 bathrooms were upstairs, so we got a little unwanted excercise. The whole place felt a bit crowded, starting with the lobby, the little room were the washer/drier was placed, and the master bathroom.\nThe location and ambience of the apartment were great, but some of the inconveniences mentioned made my stay okay.', ""Sebastien’s place was an absolute dream for our family of 4 adults. Sebastien is the kindest person you could ask for. They were incredibly responsive and helpful throughout our stay.\nThe apartment itself is perfect! It's spacious and comfortable, with everything we needed for a relaxing vacation. The location couldn't be better - we were in the heart of the action, with amazing restaurants right on our doorstep. But at the same time, the neighborhood was quiet and peaceful, allowing us to get a good night's sleep.\nWe honestly couldn't have asked for a better experience. This Airbnb is truly a gem, and we would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fantastic place to stay in Lima."", 'Excellent place, very clean, tidy.

Sebastian was very responsive and super helpful. It’s central to a lot of great restaurants and bars.', 'We are from Peru and travel to Lima often. Unfortunately we won’t be staying at this place again. The smell of pee in both bathrooms was too strong. Sebastien was quickly to send someone to clean them as soon as we sent the message but that didn’t solve the smell issue. I believe is a piping problem because we tried several cleaning products as well with no success. The place is centrally located and walkable to the hottest spots. We enjoyed flexible check in and out.', 'The pros:\nSebastien\'s is in a nice area in Miraflores, walking distance to all the attractions, stores, and nice restaurants in the area. The building is nice and has an elevator. Very convenient and clean. The hot water in the shower was great and never ran out. I appreciate that he refunded us a day for the issues we experienced in the apartment and the blankets that he provided. I also felt very welcomed on the first day when he left personalized messages. A nice touch!\nThe price is also pretty good for expensive Miraflores area.\nSuggestions for improvement:\n1) The place looks amazing in pictures but isn\'t very comfortable because a) it\'s very damp b) it\'s very cold. A simple fix for this would be to get a dehumidifier. We\'ve stayed in damp places before and host solved the problem easily with a dehumidifier. The listing also indicated ""heating"" in the amenities but only one heater was provided (despite there being 4 guests in 2 bedrooms so one couple just had to freeze. When asked for an additional portable heater, Sebastien said ""this is just how Lima is"". I was also very concerned about being electrocuted since the plug started sparking when I plugged the only portable heater in. Had to leave it off for the last night due to fire hazard concerns. I would\'ve happily paid extra for electricity to have two non-electrocuting space heaters. This could be something that the host could offer future guests to offset electricity costs while increasing comfort.\n2) wifi was periodically cut out and we kept having to restart the router. Sebastien mentioned he uses the best internet service provide in Lima. However, the issue is not the provider, it\'s the router. It would help future guests if the router was replaced.\n3) ""Cooking basics: Pots and pans, oil, salt and pepper"" was also listed in the amenities but there was no cooking oil provided. When I asked the host for some, he told me the nearest grocery store to buy it myself.\n4) The exhaust fan above the stove was broken, the middle element of the stove, and the rice cooker also didn\'t work. Please fix this for future guests.\n5) There was confusion on the last day, when one of the hosts arrived in the morning to ask why we were still there and not checked-out the day before. This is very surprising as our check-out date and time is very obviously listed in Airbnb and the host had even generously offered us a late check-out before. Then the morning of, all of that was forgotten. Not a big deal because we didn\'t need the late check-out anyway but it left a bad impression of disorganization. I think this is a misunderstanding, maybe from the hosts having to manage multiple properties and confusing us with another guest. Please double-check your guests\' check-out days on Airbnb in the future.\nIssues 2-5 were minor inconveniences that I could easily overlook, however, the heating and dampness made our stay not very comfortable and I was pretty happy to leave. Given that we only stayed 4 days, maybe Sebastien would\'ve made more of an effort to fix the comfort level for longer stays. Hopefully the issues are fixed for future guests. Thank you for crediting us a day for the issues, Sebastien. I appreciate it. The place has lots of potential and would be very comfortable without too much effort to put in the simple fixes I suggested. Hope other guests will be more comfortable!', 'Great for all aspects. Great accommodation, beautiful neighborhood, good location... I would highly recommend.', 'From start to finish we were impressed with location and the great attention from the host Sebastien. Perfect for 2 couples and would like to return to continue sightseeing in Lima. We walked to and from Larcomar to eat with no problem at all.', ""Sebastian was a great host!

Cleaning services were offered as well.\nVictor communication is superb! He checked on me frequently through my 2 month stay and even recommended local spots and attractions.\nTowards the end of my stay I had to book another AIRBNB due to flight issues and Victor was kind enough to drop off items I accidentally left at my new accommodation.\nI would highly recommend Victor's condo and I definitely look forward to booking his AIRBNB again the next time I am in Lima."", ""Well furnished apartment that lived up to its description in ad.

I am used to trafiic noise so didn't think it would disturb me, but the horns are constant! We slept well enough until around 6.30 when the roads became lively again. If you are a light sleeper I think you would struggle.\nAlso something to note - the laundry is now via an app. The app has relatively few downloads & is in Spanish & hard to navigate. Once we had managed to load & create an account my bank refused the payment as suspected it to be a scam. This is despite me approving the transaction on the App and speaking with them.\nAaron was very quick to respond & was kind enough to offer to credit my account so we could do the washing.

We gave it 4 stars because the security couldn’t find our reservation despite us filling out the form from the host, the elevators were broken much of the time, the traffic is extremely loud starting at 6:30a every morning (I lived in 2 large cities on major streets and this is worse), and the host only gave us 2 small rolls of paper for an entire week.

Rusty old washers spill water lots of water floods the laundry and kitchen and dryer can cause a serious accident because you can get electrocuted. The host knows the problem but seems she does not care. The master bathroom floor gets flooded every time you take a shower, and the very old bathtub, curtains, and walls full of mold need to be replaced smell terrible. To finish, knowing that my list is very long, I would like to add that when you open the sliding doors or windows besides the noise you have to breathe the terrible smell of marihuana all day long.

Flooded with beautiful natural light creating a very serene environment. A very comfortable and unique place to stay.', 'This was our second stay and we shall return again on our next visit. Marilu is a super hostess and accommodates our special requests when we have them.

When I arrived, I noticed very bad water damage in the wood floor outside of the bathroom and in the kitchen/living room area. I was never able to use the guest bathroom because the wall was falling apart from mold and the water damage. Although, this was not a huge problem for me because I lived alone and never had a guest.\nThen, the original water heater was leaking for the first 2 weeks until a technician came in and replaced it. The technician left a huge mess that I had to clean up by myself, which was very frustrating.\nLastly, the electrical system in the apartment is very weak. I only used the washing machine two times because the power went out whenever I used it. It was a huge hassle getting the electric company to come and turn the power back on.\nOverall, I enjoyed the apartment, but there were several issues that impacted my experience. If you are someone looking for a quiet location, this is not the right place for you. The traffic outside is deafening and the neighbors are loud throughout the night.

But be careful, if the windows in the bathroom and living room are open at the same time, it pulls imperceptibly and a cold threatens! The door lock should also be renewed once... You need it if the elevator fails once. Nevertheless, you should not worry about safety, because there is the extremely thoughtful and helpful concierge José 2 and on his days off a cozy and also nice second man.

We used Ubers every time we needed to go somewhere. We had an issue upon arrival with the washing machine/dryer not working, but Jeannet was responsive when I asked about this and got it fixed the next day. The only lingering issue we had with the space was the noise at night. Road noise, cars honking, and dogs barking/fighting was very loud every night. Jeannet helped by providing us with ear plugs to use when we brought this issue up."", 'While the flat was in a slightly less central area that tested my Spanish, it was the absolute perfect place for us to stay for a day after a solid eight days of travel.

I had booked a late flight and she allowed me to keep my luggage in the apartment longer than the checkout period. She also helped me recover a library book that I left at the apartment. 5-stars on the service. The neighborhood is not conducive to picky eaters (my daughter is vegetarian). Fully stocked grocery stores are difficult to find in this neighborhood on foot. However, Ubers are so cheap that you can overcome this by traveling to other locations relatively quickly. The views are spectacular from the apartment (small balcony allows peaceful views of the ocean creating a wow factor). The highway is noisy, especially the speedbumps but I'm a relatively heavy sleeper so this didn't bother me.

The street is quiet and far from the traffic noise of the high rise main streets of Miraflores. The apartment is spacious and beautifully renovated with two bedrooms and bathrooms. The showers were excellent and the bed enormous and very comfortable.

There is a big supermarket within 10 a minute walk of the place.\nThe place itself is very clean and Rafaella provided a water filter for drinking water which was a life saver (rather than lugging large water bottles). It has a European style/vibe, which was nice. The beds were comfortable - one king size bed and two twin size beds.\nRafaella was very responsive to the questions we had, and was always helpful. Really a great find!', 'Rafaella’s place was great; just as described and all communication was easy.

Rafaella’s home is furnished with quality furniture. The bedrooms and living room have very nice warm reading lights. In case you visit her place in wintertime, she has heaters for you and lots of blankets. Her kitchen is the most well-equipped kitchen of all Airbnbs I have stayed in (many pans, cooking utensils, coffee-maker, strainer, etc.), and I was able to cook all of my meals while staying here. The only negative thing about the place is that the home is so cozy and comfortable that I lost my willpower to explore the city.\nAlso, the host! When I arrived I was delighted to find a fruit basket with fresh fruits and a full coffee bag. You will also find an adorable guidebook in which she tells you about her favorite restaurants and other fun activities.\nOverall, only after one night I understood why her home is rated so highly. Her home is five-star all around.']",['4 guests · 2 bedrooms · 3 beds · 2 baths'],https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/5429518?adults=1&children=0&enable_m3_private_room=true&infants=0&pets=0&search_mode=regular_search&check_in=2024-11-01&check_out=2024-11-06&source_impression_id=p3_1730147325_P3B7S4zlmYIcNYvd&previous_page_section_name=1000&federated_search_id=4a17ef97-c2d1-4980-9fe1-d9a5fee60040,5429518

What we do think should be improved are the cooking utensils, they are scarce and are not in good condition, for a short stay it is surely not a problem but to spend more time - as was our case, which we also really like to cook - it is something annoying. But overall we were very comfortable at the house."", 'Perfect place to stay in Lima! Really nice apartment including a rooftop terrace with ocean views.

We liked everything, but there are a few things to change your host .\nVery poor cleaning of the apartment , all day we cleaned all the floors and dishes , everything was dirty and sticky. The second point is a small bed, it is impossible to sleep together , it is the size of 1.5.\nFeel free to book these apartments , they are very good , but ask for cleaning before your arrival.', 'Best location in Lima near all the beauty of a Barranco which is like an oasis compared to other high traffic and noisy areas of Lima - the apartment is beautiful and the rooftop terrace is awesome for relaxing with sea view and doing yoga !

The checkin- was easy and the terrace is beautiful. It’s by far my favourite part of Lima. Door men were super kind too!\nOnly small comment: Lima is very hot right now (poor planet) and the apartment is not best designed for that if your sensitive to heat.

It would also be perfect for a couple.\nThe furnishings were beautiful, and the light from the floor-to-ceiling windows was unbeatable.\nMonica was a fantastic host - she recommended places to visit in the area and checked in to see if I needed anything. The doorman was also a delight! I felt safe there as a solo female traveller."", 'Monica was the absolute best host I’ve ever had on Airbnb - she and her team went above and beyond to accommodate my very specific needs, all I had to do was ask! I stayed here after spending a week in the Amazon and it was a rough transition, I can’t thank them enough for helping make it smooth and comfortable for me. Also, the space is very cool and the location is unbeatable. Would LOVE to stay again!', ""I had rented the apartment for 10 days. It is a very nice apartment to stay in. The location is ideal and relatively very quiet. Unfortunately, I didn't meet the landlord or caretaker. Everything went through the doormen. These are very friendly and helpful. The rooftop is ideal for a enjoyable stay. Many neighbors also have a terrace of this type and on the 2 Saturday nights I was there, there was a lot of noise until 3 at night.\nThe apartment itself really needs a thorough renovation. Overall, I was very satisfied."", 'Wonderful space with incredible location in barranco.. truly a gem', 'Monica`s tri level apartment in the Bohemian and trendy Barranco district of Lima is incredible for business travelers, solo travelers and couples. It is safe, located just blocks away from the plaza, puente de los suspiros, and half a block from the malecon which lends itself to long wonderful walks over looking the pacific coast, or daily runs (as I took advantage of). The place if nicely appointed and stylish. The upper terrace (3rd level) even has a argentinian style parrilla for bbq if you are into that. There is 24 hour security and the area was very safe. Highly recommended.', 'Loved my quick stay here! I’ve been to barranco before so I know this area is amazing, but Monica still provided new recs for me. This spot is really great for 1 - 2 people.

I would definitely recommend it."", 'It was spectacular! Such an ideal location!', 'Best location ever!!! Monica is great', 'beautiful space & great location...bonus was the roof top balcony with an ocean view!', 'I had a great stay. The location was amazing. There were lots of great restaurants and cafes just as Monica described. Monica was friendly and responsive. I recommend booking this place.', 'We had booked the place for 5 nights as our hub for some extraordinary food experience in Barranco and to explore the rest of Lima. The location is perfect for this as described by the host Marina and other reviews here before. Marina was always very responsive and friendly though we didnt get to meet her in person. Due to our heavily delayed flight we checked-in late on a wednesday night which was no problem as the host had left the key with the 24/7 doorman who let us in. The area felt safe at all times even though you might find some lost souls scattering the streets and nearby park at night.\nThe place is a spacious triplex - or duplex- depending if you want to count the furnished roofterrace in. The deco and furnishings give it a nice, ancient asian-japanese twist.\nThe direct neighborhood is quiet on weekdays and we liked waking up to the sounds of birds around us. The bed was good. The WiFi worked well.\nHowever, what you pay is what you get. The place has great potential and could probably fetch a much higher rate if there had been a bit more investment beforehand. Even though it had probably undergone some touchups and a paintjob lately, things were still a bit rough. The paint in the bathroom was falling off the walls and the naked lightbulb at the ceiling had no mercy with our sleepy eyes in the morning. The once chique concrete style flooring on the groundfloor hadnt seen a thorough cleaning for a while, neither did the cupboards, plates or any drawers in the kitchen and two bathrooms. Using plates meant to wash them first. The bathroom door on first floor made the sound of a closing coffinlid which can be a funny experience at night. Shower appliances showed rusty marks, the bath- and showertub had seen better days too. Also wearing some kind of footwear, if just socks, was a Must at anytime for otherwise you would stain the sheets crawling into bed.\nAs said, one cant ask too much for the price we paid and perhaps we are too picky but especially in terms of cleanliness there should be no compromise. We are sure the host will attend to these issues immediately and the next guest will have an impeccable experience.\nKersten']",['2 guests · 1 bedroom · 1 bed · 2.5 baths'],https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/19690836?adults=1&children=0&enable_m3_private_room=true&infants=0&pets=0&search_mode=regular_search&check_in=2024-11-11&check_out=2024-11-16&source_impression_id=p3_1730147396_P3UPRp_pc7uUjES9&previous_page_section_name=1000&federated_search_id=46c1947b-7ce7-46af-8b13-62e3789cdbf6,19690836

The place was very easy to find and a quick trip from the airport. They allowed us to drop off our things early before officially checking in which was greatly appreciated. The space itself is absolutely beautiful. It is well designed, comfortable and still very chic. Its also very spacious. The photos did not do the place justice, as it was even better in person. The best part for myself and my group were the amazing views of the sea from the multiple terraces. We were able to watch the Miraflores fireworks right from the balcony.

Be prepared for noise, as it is located just off a busy street, and with 14 million people in Lima, it's to be expected. The balcony has comfortable seating and a fire pit, and we liked to hang out there. We cooked one big dinner in the kitchen and found there were adequate utensils, plates, etc.\nSpecial amenities that we appreciated—a yoga mat in the gym, enough coffee for the first few days, and housecleaners that washed dishes while we were there.\nOne note for people who are less mobile; the master suite is downstairs and some shower surfaces are slick with no grab bars.\nOverall, consider yourselves lucky to find this place. It is much better than the more expensive Marriott across the street"", 'The apartment is absolutely beautiful and exactly as shown in the pictures. Checking in was easy with Bruno, our flight arrived almost at midnight and we coordinated with a family member to pick up the keys ahead of time.

Check-in was a breeze and upon entering the apartment I found some chocolate & water bottles waiting for me which was a nice touch. The sofa's are extremely comfortable & the furniture arrangement definitely maximized the space. The bathroom is very nicely done and the water pressure on the rain shower was the icing on the cake ! The place was an 11/10 but what stood out even beyond it being an 11 out of 10 was the host. Even before I booked the place they were extremely attentive and friendly. Lodging is an integral part of a trip & can really make or break the whole stay so I definitely got lucky booking this place! This will be my go-to while in Lima!"", 'The apartment in Barranco was very clean and decorated in a minimalistic and modern way. The apartment had all the essentials which you require for a short stay, the washing machine in particular was very useful.\nThe communal areas, rooftop solarium and pool really contributed to making the apartment feel a great base to explore Barranco and Lima from, all areas were well kept.\nThe building is currently undergoing maintenance and construction in a number of apartments, this meant that during our stay there were times where this could be heard within the apartment however this tended to stop by 1900.\nDespite being spotlessly clean, as a few of the other reviews had mentioned, the apartment appears to have had some issues with moisture historically.\nWe very much enjoyed our stay in Barranco, and this apartment provided a nice place to stay.', 'Wonderful experience all in all.

Down the apartment hall there is an animal (?) that screams mid day for an hour + everyday we were there. The immediate scent when you walk in is moldy (I believe it comes from the laundry closet).

Is not as pretty or as close to the building as the pictures make it look. The unit is located in a corner and is walking distance to some shops and restaurants. Not the best area, but feels safe.

Pro-active, fast and transparent, I liked this a lot.\nThe location of the apartment is a bit out of the places you might want to visit, but you know this up front and it was fine. Uber is a great and cheap way to get around. And there is a big supermarket nearby.\nDownside of the apartment is that it is on a very busy street, so there is noise all day (and night) long.\nWe felt the apartment could use some TLC, to give it a bit of homely feel to it. For example by putting some pictures/paintings on the wall. The lighting is very bright and not very cosy. Maybe bedside lights would be nice. Also it would have been nice to have somewhere to put our stuff. For example a chair in the bedrooms, or some space in the bathrooms (there are closets there, but they have the owner’s stuff in it, so it feels a bit private to put something in there).\nFor us the biggest con was the humidity of the apartment. This could have been caused by the fog or the Ocean. We didn’t like the humid feel of the bedsheets, and also the smell of humidity/moldy smell, especially in the cupboards.\nOn the other hand, we appreciated the spaciousness of the apartment, the washing machine, the hot water and good water pressure, the fast WiFi (especially for my teenage daughter 😄) and the guy at the front desk downstairs.\nOverall we enjoyed our stay, but probably wouldn’t book here again.', 'The place is spotless and very well-located.', 'very good location', ""The apartment is ideal for us, it has a nice view and is exactly as described.

The view of the property is gorgeous, right in front the Lima Golf Club which gives you a bit of Central Park views. There’s a doorman available 24/7, which makes it easy to get into the building even after long hours. The unit is a bit old, which is fair as most of the buildings in that area go back to the 90s, yet I was expecting some outstanding renovations and decoration as it is listed as an AirbnbPlus property. The pictures are accurate, yet illumination plays a major role in disguising how old everything is inside. There’s a smell when you get in the first time which is characteristic of humidity and aging of these units. I still think it’s a great option for a single traveler, as the water heater will only allow a 5-10 minutes hot shower before taking a few hours to reheat the water.', 'The location is perfect for what I needed to do while in Lima , restaurants , supermarket , salon , the spectacular view .

I had to wear earphones and listen to white noise to get by.

It was clean, in a great location, stylish, and had great views. She left some fruit and water for us in the fridge, and the doorman was very friendly. My two small issues were that laundry was not available during my stay, which I expected based on the amenities page. I stayed Sunday-Wednesday morning, and laundry is only available on Wednesdays and Fridays, which I didn't know beforehand. It would have been nice to know so I could have packed a little heavier. I mentioned it to Claudia, and she said she'd update the page if she can. No big deal though, I just did some laundry (on my own dime) at a lavanderia. The second little thing is that there's a cool pool on the roof (15th floor), but when we went to go swimming it was really dirty with murky water. We were kind of surprised that, especially in the summer months, the pool didn't look maintained. We decided not to swim. Claudia was very responsive though the whole time, and she said she'd check on both issues for the future. Overall, would definitely recommend!"", 'By far the best apartment of my entire trip to Peru, the magnificent view, the comfort, the accessories for cooking, the beauty of the neighborhood and the services nearby and what to say about Claudia, super welcoming and really there for us when needed.', ""Another great beautiful apartment. I stayed in 2 of Alonso and Claudia's apartments because I wanted to see 2 different sides of the city. This apartment is located in a more urban area with more locals than tourist. Reminded me of a LA kind of vibe. Alonso even picked me up to take me to this second unit (AMAZING customer service). He recommended all of the great places to eat in the area. Delivered fresh towels the next morning. Fridge was full of fresh fruit and even eggs and filtered water. I had an issue with my flight out and Alonso even helped me with getting another flight out and offered me the same unit to come back to.

Little touches all around meant we had what we need throughout our week long stay.\nVery fast WiFi - we really tested it with working remotely, 2 laptops and 3 smartphones connected at once and never had issues or any glitches even on video calls.\nGreat location in Barranco and views to the ocean from both floors.\nWould be great for 2 couples that wanted privacy/space, as each of the double bedrooms are on different floors with their own bathrooms and balconies.\nGreat fast communication from Julio and he was able to give us late check out because of a late flight!\nNot a negative in our eyes, but just something to know - the 1st floor residents have a band and practice occasionally (for us around 11am on weekdays) so just something to know in case you are planning to work here and have any virtual meetings. But for us it was actually lovely to hear the live music floating through the windows!\nThank you!', 'Julio responded quickly, flexible on arrival and was very helpful. It is spacious apartment with kitchen which is well equipped.\nSupermarket is close by and plenty of restaurants around.', 'We had an excellent stay here.\nIt is clean and spacious and close to everything.\n5 stars, would recommend.', 'Julio’s place in Barranco is a lovely and inviting home with plenty of space for all the group. It is in a nice and safe location within walking distance to a variety of good restaurants and super market. Julio was also very easy to communicate with and check in was a breeze with Julio meeting us on the day to give a run down of the home. The home also offered a washing machine and dryer which was a real convenience.\nI would stay again anytime without question!', 'Stunning place , great host , very accommodating, very homey feels , if you are planning to visit barranco , couldn’t be better located than this area , definitely recommend, we absolutely love the place\nThank you 😊 and hopefully we crossed paths again cheers', 'Location, cleanliness, and size of the apartment are great. Would stay here again if visiting Lima', 'It’s a very nice apartment in a great part of Barranco. It’s homey and welcoming. The pictures does not do justice to the balconies that span the outside of the apartment on both floors. There is always both Sun and shade to be had. We stayed during the hottest part of the year (Jan) and while it was occasionally warm in the apartment, it was possible to create a cross breeze in the main rooms (multiple windows) making it pleasant. The quiet fans helped too. An extra bonus is the filtered water making it drinkable. The hosts were very helpful and let us check in early. Thank you!', 'Already my second stay in this great apartment...always beautiful, the location, the view and the very nice and uncomplicated hosts!\nI\'d love to come back to this beautiful ""home"".', 'It is a duplex with a large balcony, a beautiful view of the sea and in a very nice neighborhood. The apartment is very comfortable, every room has its bathroom, excellent for washing and drying clothes, well stocked with towels and sheets, well equipped. Maria Luisa is super friendly. Highly recommended!', ""Julio's place is in a good location in Barranco. Communication and check in were spot on. The house is good sized with plenty of room to sprawl about. Laundry is a nice feature if you need to do it. The place is accurately described, and I think a good value for your money. There is a big grocery story store two blocks away and many restaurants close. I felt that the neighborhood was safe with plenty of police visible. The place is two blocks away from the malecon with beautiful views of the costa verde . If you are a light sleeper the club across the street does play music loud starting after 8:00 and can go into the early morning hours. Is it loud in the house? No, but if you like to sleep with the windows open you will hear it. We could deal with it, but everyone is different. I choose to look at it this way. Great price, cool location, nice house, I could accept the neighbors I have no control of anyway. Enjoy Lima, I did.""]",['5 guests · 3 bedrooms · 3 beds · 3.5 baths'],https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/6613568?adults=1&children=0&enable_m3_private_room=true&infants=0&pets=0&search_mode=regular_search&check_in=2024-11-09&check_out=2024-11-14&source_impression_id=p3_1730147396_P3i0IQDuKLUO4o06&previous_page_section_name=1000&federated_search_id=46c1947b-7ce7-46af-8b13-62e3789cdbf6,6613568
