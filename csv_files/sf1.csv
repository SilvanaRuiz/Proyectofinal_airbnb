4.98",299,Superhost,11 years hosting,€ 224 ,"[""Ben's offers modern touches in a historic Victorian home. The internet was lightening fast which was wonderful for a few video meetings I needed to do. Ben provided a starter set of eggs, butter, milk, and juice. I made a few meals at home and found the cookware to be of high quality. The place was conveniently located near Golden Gate Park, the University, and many coffee shops and cafes. I felt comfortable walking everywhere I wanted to go during the daytime. Ben was super communicative about instructions and I was grateful he let me check in a bit early since I took an early flight from the east coast and the apartment was ready. This allowed me to spend more time with my niece and nephew who I came to visit. I would definitely stay here again. The place was perfect for my needs."", 'Ben’s place was great. Very easy to find and get inside. Ben was also right next door in case we needed anything and gave very clear instructions on anything we needed to know.

The beautiful spacious light-drenched flat is well renovated with a simple minimalist aesthetic that makes you want to spend time there. Perfectly located 1 block from vibrant Cole Street, but totally safe and peaceful, it's now my favorite neighborhood San Francisco. Ben and his wife are ideal hosts-- proactive, incredibly friendly, and in the same building, but totally respectful of our privacy as well.\nThe only possible question mark for you staying here is if you have a toddler, the (nice gas stove) heater is located at floor level in the living room and gets really hot. So, if you're in a season of San Francisco where you need heat, but your toddler likes to run around, you'll need to pay attention to them when it's turned on. It worked out totally fine for us with a 2.5 year old-- we just had it on at night while asleep.\nBen's place will be our #1 choice for any future trips to the Bay Area, without question."", 'Excellent place to stay!

I can say enthusiastically report that Ben's property was the most immaculate and well located I've ever had the privilege of staying in. Ben was very responsive and helpful throughout our stay and made us feel taken care of. Although this property is located in the heart of SF, it is very quiet during the night owing to its tucked away feeling location in Cole Valley. We even had the opportunity to meet with Ben as we were loading out for departure at the end of our stay. He was every bit as kind as he had seemed via his messages during our stay. We hope to return as soon as possible."", 'We absolutely loved our time at Ben’s place. He’s an outstanding host - very helpful and friendly.

It’s close enough to The Haight, Golden Gate Park and Cole Valley without the noise since you’re up the hill a bit (but not so much up the hill that you’re dreading the walk). Just remember that you’re still in a city; there’s some amount of noise no matter where you are but the garbage truck was about it. Laundry and dishwasher are great to have as well. Not sure we’ll stay anywhere else when we visit.', 'Ben’s apartment was perfect for our 8 night stay in San Francisco.

I highly recommend!!', 'The host was amazing and very responsive and very responsive.The room is very clean!', 'The house was great, very modern.\nNice amenities. Easy to use thermostat. Garage space for parking is available. Driveway parking is also available.\nQuiet neighborhood.\nClose proximity to some restaurants.\nI don’t know SF area too well as far as giving a rating on proximity to popular sites, but a lot of the places that went to were never more than 10 miles (no more than 20 min) away.\nWould definitely stay again.', ""Beautiful newly renovated house. Quiet neighborhood. Not in the beautiful area of San Francisco. But safe and quiet. From 6am in the morning you can hear the planes take off.\nThe photos seem to be taken for airbnb, because the furniture does not match reality: the sofa is dark grey, the beds are different from the pictures, there is no single furniture in the garden, the paintings and tables and chairs are all different. There is an immensely large TV in the living room, not in the photos, for example.\nBut very nice and chic kitchen, chic bathroom, three large bedrooms with very soft bedding. Lots of towels. 1 downside to the main bathroom is that the water doesn't get hot in the shower and 1 sink. Warm, but not hot. It gets nice and hot in the small bathroom. Windows and doors screens everywhere. Nice large washing machine and dryer are available. Under 20€ to downtown with Uber."", 'Kenny was an absolutely amazing host. Had a small issue with the breaker and he came over right away to fix it. Can’t thank him enough for the great experience. Everything was super close to what we wanted to see.

The house is spacious and modern, the beds are very comfortable and the furnishings are new and of high quality. But there is one small point of criticism: the floor was a bit dusty. Neverthele, the accommodation is highly recommended.', 'Great stay, I’m happy I found this place. Easy to get in and place was beautiful, spacious, modern and free of clutter. I specifically loved the parking. Area appear to be safe, no issues noted.

Great place to stay and easy travel into San Fransisco itself.', ""The house was perfect for our vacation in San Francisco. The neighbourhood is quiet and the house is a short drive to downtown San Francisco and the airport. The kitchen is well equipped for cooking which was appreciated. The beds are comfortable although the pillows were too flat for our liking. It was also nice having a garage to park in. When we needed assistance after being locked out, Kenny responded quickly and came to help us out in no time. We would have liked the water temperature in the showers to match the heat we could get out of other taps, but it wasn't a big problem and we would stay there again. Thanks for a great stay!"", 'The house was cozy and we enjoyed being there however,the issue was no hot water I contacted Kenny via message and tried to call the number with no response. there was no hot water either night we were there.', 'So much better than a hotel!\nA colleague and I needed to go to SF for a work trip, and instead of the expensive hotels in the area, we were lucky to find Kenny‘s gorgeous modern home. It’s in a neighborhood that was close to everywhere we needed to go, and the two car garage was great compared to other Airbnbs (even though the street was clearly safe for overnight parking.)\nThe house has everything you need - I recommend turning on the heat fan in the main bathroom just before you get in the shower so the room is toasty when you get out. Loved it! We enjoyed opening the windows in the living room and enjoying the view of the city with our coffee.\nKenny is a fantastic host- super responsive and made sure we were comfortable. There was an unexpected power outage, but Kenny was extremely responsive to make sure we were ok, had options for the night, and brought over some flashlights in case it took longer to restore. Not his fault, but he stepped in and made it all right. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️', 'Kenny’s house is beautiful and clean. We locked ourselves out of one of our bedrooms right before we had to leave for our flight. Kenny’s wife was responsive and came to open the door in 30 minutes we were grateful! Check in was very easy. Some cons are you cannot use air conditioner, there is a closet in the guest room yet no shelves or bar to hang clothes. The master bedroom closet had shelves that were on the floor and clearly not yet Installed. Also, it would be helpful if they provided wash cloths. I say all that to say, this house is really nice. If those few things are fixed it would be a five star home.', 'Loved this place. It was clean and modern. We’d definitely stay here again if we were in the area', 'Great new home.

The house is modern and stylish. We especially loved the big TV. The location seemed very good and safe, around 15-20 minutes drive to downtown and most touristy locations. While the 3 bedrooms were great, we found the mattress in master bedroom quite firm for our liking. Everything else was amazing and we surely recommend this place! The checkin, check out and other instructions about the house were very clear and easy to work with. The hosts were very easy to communicate with and responsive.', 'Great place, nice and clean, responsive host. Nothing to criticize.', 'Kenny was very nice and responsive. His place was nice and clean. Outdoor didn’t have any bench as picture showed. One of the reasons I booked was so my son had some outdoor area to play but it was pretty cold too— but no benches so we couldn’t play etc. Inside was nice n clean/ I didn’t like how there was no remote for the garage and also that the bedrooms kitchen are upstairs.', 'One of the nicest airbnbs I’ve stayed in.

Kenny was easy to reach and very helpful!', 'Aside from the house being so gorgeous and just like the pictures, the host and his wife were absolutely wonderful. We needed something in the middle of the night and they stopped what they were doing to come over. I would book with them any time I’m in the city again! I personally loved having a garage, a back yard, and laundry. Really great additions to the space that I never expect in airbnbs. I will say, their beds are very firm. I would have loved a mattress topper since I’m a side sleeper. But we were so exhausted from exploring every day that we slept just fine anyway! This house is about a 5-10 drive to all the main “tourist” areas in San Francisco. Amazing for the price!', 'The home was clean and as described.', 'Overall was good. Quite neighborhood. Comfy bedding and clean linen. However the flooring in the entire home was not clean even though no shoes allowed. Master bath had loose tile flooring.

Came to San Francisco for my 30th birthday and booked with Kenny. For starters the photos did no justice to what I seen when I arrived. I stayed here 4 days and the 1st day was just taking in how beautiful this home is. Extremely modern from the curb appeal to interior. I never wanted to leave the living room at all. Don’t remember the size but it seemed to be about an 80” Samsung curve tv was phenomenal to watch. Sofa was comfy. Loved the open concept of the modern kitchen with all stainless steel appliances. The 2 bathrooms was a plus for guests because the on suite is private in which i absolutely fell in love with the barn door leading into a phenomenal master closet, double vanities, and a extra large walk in shower. I can rant all day about this gorgeous place ! Kenny you did a phenomenal job with this listing.', 'Kenny’s place was amazing, it was more then the pictures.

It is located in a very quiet neighborhood and (great luxury) has a free parking space and a garage so super convenient. The point of improvement is in terms of decoration. In the photos we see paintings, plants, garden furniture etc that are not in the apartment which gives a slightly cold look, personal if I take BnB air and not hotel rooms it is precisely for this little extra that is still missing here but I am sure that once everything is finished this accommodation will be perfect"", 'Great location - pretty convenient to everything.

She had snacks, appliances, shampoo/conditioner, sunscreen, and more. Very clean and comfortable.\nHOWEVER, (& this is entirely our own fault), this is not a warm place. It is foggy & cold, even in the summer. While you’re a block from the beach/ocean, it isn’t warm enough to swim without a wetsuit. This area is the Seattle of California. To get to the tourist sites, such as the golden gate and the piers we had to take 1, sometimes 2 buses or Ubers to navigate the city. Even with the buses & uber, we still somehow walked between 8-15 miles a day. However, go inland to these places & it’s nice & sunny. Still can get cold, so bring a sweater but the inland parts are much warmer. The groceries were very expensive.\nAs long as you do your research and come with the expectation that this won’t be a normal “beach” vacation then this is perfect for you!', 'We had a great stay at Michelle’s place. She gave us some great local recommendations and was helpful and accommodating to all our requests', ""Michele is a fantastic host. Well before my visit, she sent helpful information about the house and neighborhood. Then when I arrived, she came outside to greet me and show me to my room. We had a wonderful conversation, and she gave me tips on places to eat in the vicinity.

She provided us with a very detailed homebook which simplified our arrival, and left some treats at the appartment (much appreciated!). The appartment is very clean and neat, and located in a very quiet area outside San Francisco downtown, 1 block away from the ocean. Nonetheless, you can take a bus which is at 5 min walking distance that will take you downtown in 30 min. Therefore I could left my car in the street for free (which is a luxury in SF!). A delicious fresh market (Gus) is at 10 min walking distance.\nThe only thing to take into account is that there is no hob (microwave and a pizza oven are available though ;-)) and no dinner table. It was not a problem for us, and was specified in the description anyway.\nI can only recommend Michele's appartment. Thank you for the stay!"", 'Very, very nice place and Michelle provided written information to refer to. She also had maps and pamphlets with info of the area.', 'Wonderful spot!

Can’t go wrong with this AirBnb!', ""Michelle's place was extremely clean and well-maintained, giving off a cozy apartment feel. The kitchen came equipped with all necessary utensils and the bathroom was stocked with plenty of towels. The bed was also very comfortable to sleep in. Additionally, the backyard was a nice touch. The location is a short distance away from Ocean Beach, which is a great perk. If you're here, I highly recommend checking out Andy Town's coffee. Michelle's place is conveniently located near SF Zoo, Golden Gate Park, and Stonestown Galleria Mall. Overall, I had an excellent first Airbnb experience and would give Michelle's place a 5 out of 5 stars."", 'Michele is such a thoughtful host! We arrived super late into the evening and she was kind enough to stay up to make sure we made it in safely. Her place was immaculately clean, bed was soft and comfortable, and there’s even an electric heater she provided for when the nights got cold.

Yes, it’s small, but that’s par for the course for this area. A very nicely renovated place, with almost every amenity imaginable. Easy walk to the beach. A few restaurants nearby within a few blocks, but overall it’s a residential neighborhood that’s easy to get around. Parking is on the street, first come first serve, but we were always able to find a spot within a half block away. There is a driveway available for unloading. The host was there to greet us and help us get in, as well as give advice for the area. Great value!', ""The apartment is actually far from everything you can see and do in San Francisco, the car is indispensable. The apartment itself is fine, but some details are needed. For example, a table to take the food, it doesn't have it! The mattress where you fall asleep is old and somewhat uncomfortable. The closet is partially occupied with two large suitcases, some clothes and other things. The bathroom is the best, spacious and clean.

We would occasionally run into Amy, her husband, or her children, but they were very respectful of our privacy once we were in the beautiful suite.\nThe suite is fantastic, with all the amenities we needed for our 2-night stay. From the large shower to the kitchenette, to the toiletries and food/drink items Amy provided, we felt right at home and that we had everything we needed.\nThere are reasonable house rules that Amy asks for — removing shoes, quiet after 10pm, etc. — if you’re willing to follow these and be respectful of the family living in the home, this is the perfect place to stay while exploring San Francisco.', ""We stayed at Amy's place for a week and it was amazing!

You're also only a few blocks from multiple BART lines that will get you lots of places you'll want to go.\nAmy and her husband communicated very well. We were already going to be arriving late but when our second flight got delayed they gave us good instructions on how to find the key and get inside.\nOne thing I will point out is that, while the area is self-contained, you are definitely in a home where people are going about their day and sleeping at night. If you're the type that likes to listen to music or watch TV late this might not be the best place. We were very glad that they let us know, via text, when our show had gotten too loud as we could easily turn it down.\nWe would definitely recommend it."", ""Amy's place is very spacious and clean,located in a great part of the Mission with close proximity to restaurants and BART.\nAmy was a great host, very quick to communicate with and very accommodating.

Other than that, the panorama view from the front door is very impressive. The apartment is super clean, and host even prepared fruits and snakes on the table (very sweet)! I would definitely come back the next time I visit SF."", 'The apartment is really great/fantastic. It is allowed with all and attention to detail. You immediately feel comfortable and home. The location is also great in a hilly residential area, as you have a great west view of a part of the city. You can go well with the local bus to the center. However, in our experience, I would recommend a car, which is more relaxed and faster on weekdays (on weekends, the center of the car is not recommended).\nAn experience is the impressively steep road right outside the front door. If parking is too difficult, you can also park in the street around the corner. Attention at the road must be taken care of the times of the signage.

On check in day George called me to make sure all was good with entering the studio and with the instructions and to contact him if any concerns. Check in and check out were easy. George is very concerned with safety and security and that made me feel very safe especially since I stayed by myself for two nights after my husband left for another trip.\nMy husband and I had lots of space to hang out without feeling cramped. We appreciated the extra blankets and thick towels and especially the space heater which we put to good use since it was cool and windy out during our stay. The studio also had fun and interesting SF history books and walking tour books to help you learn about the city.\nA few things to note:\n-The water pressure in the shower is low and would be a challenge for those with thick or long hair. Lots of hot water though.\n-The bed is creaky and may be uncomfortable for some, but naps on the comfy couch were wonderful!\n-Given the nature of these older buildings you'll hear movements of the residents upstairs and smell whatever foods they are cooking. Also, we heard the pleasant sounds of someone practicing piano.\nAll in all, a great stay! Thank you George!"", 'George is a great host. And the studio was perfect for my son and I. We were visiting for my daughters engagement party. I’m sure we will be back many times before the wedding.

Thanks for all!', 'Place was centrally located and a good starting point for our excursions. Very clean and well kept with no issues.', ""The studio is in a great location, very walkable neighborhood and close to many points of interest in the area. The space is private and was exactly the refuge I was looking for while attending a work conference in the Castro.\nGeorge equips the studio with all the little comforts that you might have forgotten, e.g., blow dryer, fan, iron, coffee, shampoo.\nGeorge's check-in instructions were easy to follow.\nI will definitely rebook George's studio the next time I am in the area."", 'This is a great location- the studio has the basics but it is not the most comfortable place. The worst thing was the bed that was very springy and gave us the opposite of a restful night. Also the heat is apparently controlled by the upstairs residents who set their thermostat on too high, and when they are not home the thermostat is off. There is a small space heater for such occasions but overall you’re not able to set your own desired temperature. We also found lots of ants in the bathroom and kitchen and a few spiders but that’s to be expected in winter in a basement unit.\nWe had some issues with our flight and when we worried we couldn’t make it and messaged the host, George asking if we could get a refund in the event we couldn’t get a new flight he suddenly disappeared and stopped responding. He didn’t message us to see if we had arrived ok or needed anything.\nOverall this is a great location for a convenient price, but it’s neither elegant, cozy or comfortable.', ""The place is exactly as described. For two people, it's a perfect size for a short stay. It is close to public transit, as well as numerous local attractions such as the golden gate park. Keep in mind that there is no stove for the kitchen area, and there is limited sunlight coming into the basement apartment. The place was clean, and George was always readily available as needed. George also provided very detailed instructions for our stay, and made the process all the easier. George was also flexible for early check in and late check out options, and places to store our luggage. Thank you again for hosting us for our first trip to SF!"", ""Great stay at George's place, the place is near the haight ashbury, Castro, mission, and golden gate Park neighborhood, in a quiet residential area, away from the hustle and bustle of the heart of the city. A supermarket is nearby, allowing you to shop when you return from a day of sightseeing.\nAccommodation is nice, with private access and a small courtyard. The bedding was very comfortable (including the sofa bed) and everything was spotlessly clean.

His spot was clean and it’s in a great location. There’s so much to walk to, the panhandle, various eateries and it’s on the 21Hayes bus line.

Perfect for a couple.', 'George is a great host. Very thorough with his instructions and always easy to reach out to.

Near the beautiful Golden Gate Park, good stores, restaurants and some very cool and fun bars.', ""I've stayed in about a half dozen AirBnB's in San Francisco in the last 7 years. George's place exceeded them all, which is saying quite a lot. His is now the one I will always measure other Studio/1 BR AirBnB's against. The level of detail, forethought, and anticipated guest experience needs and wants that George has in store for you will be difficult to match. I've never had a host who was more flexible and accommodating. Plus, he's a genuinely welcoming and kind host.

It really felt as if George had spent a fair amount of time living in this unit as well, because all of the little touches were present. Whether this was hangers and a dresser in the closet, a hair dryer, umbrellas, AC/heat -- everything felt taken care of. The bed was comfortable and I always felt like I had privacy. George was highly communicative and I even saw him on the way out one morning.\nOne note I have -- I had 0 cell service (T-Mobile) in this unit. This may be because it's located at garden level, but maybe those on other networks won't have any problems. This wasn't a huge issue for me as iMessage and other apps worked just fine on George's wifi, but I could imagine an Android user having a rough time with calls or texts here.\nThe neighborhood was great and walkable.

Lynn gave me a very detailed introduction to SF as a city, as well as a ton of things to do while I'm here.\nThe accommodation itself is located in a quieter neighbourhood, a bit further away from the city centre. But there's still a lot to do. The proximity to Golden Gate Park, the 16th Avenue steps, and Lands End was something I made sure to account for before choosing to stay here.

We didn't actually get to chat too much, but I can tell that they cleaned the place pretty much every day.

It’s true that there is a middle school right next door- there are kids playing outside pretty consistently between 9 am and whenever they get out. It’s pretty noisy but, if you’re a tourist, you won’t be staying inside much anyway.

There were great restaurants and coffee shops on the same block practically. The space itself had great views of the city and the apartment had all the things we needed for our trip. As far as downsides, I would say that the lofted bed can be a bit challenging in a few ways. The space up there is extremely bright in the mornings as well as extremely hot during the day. There is very little ventilation and no blinds so just be aware that you might need to keep the front door open for a while before bed until the room cools down, and you might need to bring a very good sleep mask. The ladder can be tricky as well – the rungs are rounded instead of flat which makes it a little more painful to go up and down if you don’t have shoes on. the kitchen has a very strange layout including steps up to the sink, in case you’re looking for a place to cook', 'Everything about the listing was just as described and just right.

I stayed in this beautiful loft for 1.5 weeks and it was perfect. Fast, reliable internet when I needed and a perfect amount of space. The place is thoughtfully curated down to the slightest details. Just remember, it is a loft, so you do have to go up a ladder to the bed. The bed is very comfortable! There's also a set of stairs you have to take to access the apartment. As long as that's not an issue for you, then it's perfect. Because of the high ceilings, it did get hot during the day, so I'd need to open the door and window often to get cooler airflow. This is all fairly typical of SF homes though. Lots of great coffee shops and good eats right around the corner.

This trip, we attempted to use the kitchen more, and found that it wasn’t well-equipped (to prep a rice dish with steamed veggies and baked tofu—providing detail here, to note what was hard to do).

Communication was superb', 'The home, location, view, everything was simply perfect for our 15th anniversary trip! We cannot wait to return!', 'Sensational position overlooking Muir Beach and beyond. It is a great place with remarkable views, but for the price not as well stocked as you would expect. Remembering it is a 20 minute drive to and from the nearest market, the kitchen equipment is extremely basic, missing scissors, blender and cafetiere. The oven works well, but it means lying on the floor with a flashlight to operate it. Bed was OK but with standard sheets and towels. No lotion, conditioner or robes as you find in other places at this price point. Owner was reluctant to reimburse us for the two nights without power.', 'Had a lovely stay here for our 1yr anniversary.

It was just the best!', 'Beautiful very quite and peaceful', 'We had a wonderful time at Sigward’s beach house!

A beautiful place to wake up to and enjoy a coffee on the deck. Would 100% recommend.', 'This is the best place I’ve ever stayed at. I would say the pictures don’t accurately show the space because it was beyond incredible. The kitchen was open and has so much space it was easy to cook every meal. The view is spectacular and we could stare out the windows all day long. Easy access to the beach and a beautiful fireplace to warm up if it’s chilly. Just a spectacular stay and so thankful this place was shared on Air bnb!!', ""The home was perfect for our get-away! Sigward provides detailed directions in advance, and the home is actually easy to find if you review them prior to your drive. Home is exactly as listed, no surprises, except for a view that takes your breath away even when you think you're prepared! Very quiet except for the pounding of the surf! The clear glass (?) on the deck is perfect to block the ocean breeze so you can enjoy the deck anytime without diminishing the view. Very friendly neighbors when we were around the carport offering suggestions of things to see. You know in advance what is in the kitchen, so we brought everything else we needed and enjoyed breakfast & dinner on the deck or at the dining table that overlooks the Pacific. Couldn't have found a restaurant in the area with better views and comforting surroundings for us. So close to Muir Woods, the Marin Headlands, Sausalito and Mill Valley you'll have plenty to explore. We would enjoy the opportunity to return"", 'Sigward is an awesome host!! We had the best time.

Also stellar sound system to link up all your favorite tunes. Thank you Sigward for this beautiful gem!', 'This is just an awesome location that provides the solitude and ocean views that are very hard to beat.

Highly recommend!', 'I saw this place and I knew I had to stay there. It is the absolute closest place to Muir Beach and makes it feel like that is your own private beach.\nThe place has plenty of patina and fits the surroundings. This place is perfect for one or two people to get away for a couple of days and just enjoy spending quiet time together.\nSigward is great with communication, honest about what to expect and covers all the bases prior to your arrival.\nHighly recommend.', 'I’m torn between 4and5 stars.The location is amazing.The views are unbeatable.The best hike we did was walkable from the house.Hot tub was hot.Plenty of firewood and functioning wood fireplace. It was a very relaxing and enjoyable stay.We loved having the sliding doors open and hearing the ocean and literally a million dollar view.I would only take a star off for a cosmetic review.When first arriving, I was surprised at how rustic and “mountain home-esk” it was.I think the views in the listing(which are true to life)distracted me from some of the other cosmetics of the home. To be honest, the rustic charm did grow on me, but the inside is very basic.The couch was comfy.The kitchen was plenty big and functional, although we didn’t cook much.Bathroom was outdated.We wish there would have been something like a boogie board to use at the beach.The deck pictures are old and it could use restraining as well as some nicer patio furniture.High cleaning expectations for the price you are paying', 'You can’t beat the views sigwards house offers. Just incredible. It’s the only house that feels like your right over the top of the beach. I can’t wait to book it again.', 'We just spent 2 wonderful days in Muir Beach at Sigward’s place. What a gem! The view from the house is beyond fantastic. We could have spent all day watching the dogs playing on the beach from the house’s balcony. But alas, we did not because there is too much hiking to do around Muir Beach. We did not plan our trip to Muir Wood and as such we did not have a parking reservation so we parked at the Redwood Creek trailhead and hiked into Muir Wood (added 4 miles to the hike). It was fantastic! The next day we went in to Point Reyes national seashore. After hiking we just went back to the house for a dip in the jacuzzi and then enjoyed dinner listening to music through the wonderful bluetooth speakers with a very cozy fire in the fireplace. We definitely want to come back to Sigward’s place to explore more of the area. We also ran into a bobcat when walking to the Pelican Inn for an authentic British beer.', 'My husband and I lived in SF for over 40 years. This was a time travel trip for us... Marin holds so many memories, but the house and its position overlooking Muir Beach was the star, letting us trip back to the late 1960s where we could feel like Bohemians once again! I wanted to just permanently move in and relive those happy, hippy days of listening to the ocean waves, the calls of the gulls and crows while watching lines of pelicans winging across the sky as I painted my watercolors on the sunlit deck. Truly a remarkable location!', 'The view was absolutely fantastic. Peaceful surroundings and Sigward was a fabulous host.', 'The view overlooking Muir Beach was insanely spectacular and close to Muir Woods. Happy to have stayed here! The house is an older coast home but comfortable.', 'For us as a couple it was a great and quiet getaway with a breathtaking view on the ocean. Sigward prepared everything perfectly in advance and was very responsive during our stay. This and the very private beach house let us have an unforgettable stay at Muir Beach.', ""The moment we sat down the sound of the waves lulled us into relaxation that we almost forgot all about out Muir Woods reservations! We were reluctant to get up and moving. The house has such character, I was in love with the old fashion fixtures in the bathroom. I deal with chronic pain and am always nervous about comfort when traveling, the couch and bed were wonderful. My husband loved the speakers in the livingroom, very easy to use. Sigward was great to communicate with, he will make sure you have all the information you need for a wonderful stay. And of course the view is everything you want it to be!!! We didn't end up venturing down to the beach, but did see where the neighbors were coming up a staircase. I loved how I could rest at the cottage, but still be a part of the sunshine, and sound and sights of the beach. It was magical. Great way to spend our 24th anniversary. Sigward, thank you for sharing."", ""This place is a jewel - I wish I owned it. I live in the Bay Area, an hour away, so it was a staycation. My two day stay was so wonderful that I recommended to my family and friends before I even left the premises. I'll definitely stay here again this year.\nMy stay was amazing and so was the host and the groundskeeper. Before I arrived, the host communicated thru email & in an introductory phone call to inform me about the amenities, give me property info and local recommendations, and he allowed me to ask any questions.\nThe place is homey--decorated for comfortability. I did light cooking & brought food too & the kitchen worked for that.\nThe heaters work well and are easy to use if you follow the directions. Make sure to get there in daylight, the is one way road is on a hillside.\nNice area for walks, view is unmatched of the water, hillside, and homes. The solace in surroundings is felt deep down. My favorite part was the seclusion and hearing the waves throughout my time there."", 'Sigward was very responsive and supportive.', 'We stayed at Sigward’s place for the first few days of our honeymoon.

If you’re considering his place, hurry up and book before someone beats you to it! Look forward to returning again some day soon.', 'Sigward was awesome from the initial call to meet each other over the phone, to the clear directions and house rules, all the way through to the exit instructions he was friendly and professional. The view is phenomenal and you can quickly walk down to Muir Beach. For the price frankly a TV would have been nice, but Sigward made it clear this property is mainly catered towards couples, where I can see a TV might not be as important. Overall an outstanding experience, just make sure to be prepared for the lack of nearby stores or restaurants and the potential heavy traffic getting there from Mill Valley or heading over to Stinson. Would rent again.', 'Beautiful location. Wonderful views. Very relaxing home.', 'Absolutely incredible place. Very grateful for the amazing experience we had.

Mauricio was so gracious to let us check in early so we could go out and explore the city our on first day. We did not run into any issues during our stay there but it was comforting to know he was close by in case problems came fourth. We wanted to find a location that was close to public transportation so we could easily explore the city. This was located very conveniently by the Muni Station (which we used the 7 day pass) and a few blocks away from the BART station (airport). Whole Foods was just a short 10 min walk which we went to frequently for small items.

Yulie and Anatoly were responsive to messages once we were there for our stay, and even provided tips about the local music scene. The only issue we had was the sleeper sofa was VERY uncomfortable. I tried sleeping on it the correct way and the 4 inch memory foam mattress did little to protect from the frame. The fan for the bathroom wasn’t operational, but this was a new problem and Yulie and Anatoly were notified. I hope to be able to come back and stay here again.

I arrived late and tired after a conference so was very relieved to see some tasty dehydrated ramen noodles kindly left in the kitchenette. There was a little noise from wind and a creature on top of the roof one night, but in my experience this made it feel more cosy too be tucked up inside. The studio is up lots of stairs and the street is on quite a steep hill, something to consider when travelling with a large suitcase, but this is a common characteristic to many San Francisco homes.

Note that for anyone tall (I am 6’2”), some parts like the shower will be tight on space. Otherwise the place had what I needed: a bed, a desk, a fridge, and a full bathroom.

No bed bugs/ants/insects/mosquitos/cockroaches whatsoever during my one-month stay. Very comfy bed. Mini-fridge cleanliness OK. The room is facing the street so hearing passing cars and buses during late night and early morning could be disturbing but I get used to it quickly.

I just ignored the sound and could still had my sleep.\nThe kitchen –\nBlue ocean-themed large kitchen equipped with anything you might need which is great for short or long-term stays. I felt like home and sometimes couldn’t help singing to myself. I found a tiny spider-like insect crawling only once.\nThe shared bathroom –\nHot water round the clock. Room for improvement in terms of cleanliness standard like the floor, wash basin and toilet seat cover. I found an insect flying low in the bathroom soon after I checked in and told the cleaning lady. I found no insect from then onwards.\nLaundry –\nSometimes the washing machine is not functioning very well.\nHost –\nA very kind, understanding and helpful host. Respect guest’s privacy. I rarely run into him but Geoffrey gave extremely prompt and clear response when I texted him if he knew any nearby covid-19 test location. Geoffrey also allowed me to use the kitchen and bathroom after I had checked out. Other guests are quiet and nice especially David.\nLocation –\nEasy access to public transportation and just minutes’ walk to BART, MUNI, grocery stores and restaurants. It takes about half an hour to get to downtown using public transport.\nNeighbourhood –\nSafe and friendly. No homeless people around. Dog shit problem is not serious.\nAs a movie fanatic, I originally planned to visit San Francisco in April to attend the San Francisco International Film Festival and book a hotel but due to COVID, I postponed my trip and booked Geoffrey’s place for August and September.

When I arrived, I thought I knew what to expect based on the listing’s beautiful photos, descriptive details, list of amenities, and fantastic reviews. However, what I remember about my stay is not only the loft itself (which is just as stunning in real life), but the experience that the Hosts created. I received the warmest welcome and tour from Superhosts who clearly love sharing their home and have gone to the greatest extent to make this Airbnb feel like a real home with all the thoughtful touches. I felt reassured to settle in and live in this space for the week of my visit. Refraining from going into specific detail, as I would not want to take away from the experience for any new guests, I cannot recommend the SoMa Loft enough, and I would love to return to this ‘home away from home’ in the future!', 'Vera and Cleber were great!\nThey communicated with me at least a week before check-in to make sure they answered any questions I had.

The unit is comfortable with all the amenities I could ask for. Wine, chocolates, new appliances, attentive super hosts.

But I found a masseuse within a block with an open spot the next day - 90 minutes later I was good as new. The unit is also close to a few excellent restaurants. I picked it because of close proximity to the Moscone Convention Center, and also the superb ratings. I’ll confirm all the previous ratings.', ""Thanks to all the glowing reviews of Vera and Cléber's place, we thought we knew what to expect... but we were blown away even so. The apartment is spacious and attractive, the hosts extremely quick and thorough in answering any questions, and there were loads of great extras, including fresh fruit, juice to our preference, cheeses, wine, chocolate, and a delicious loaf of sourdough. There was even an avocado ready to be made into avocado toast. Every part of the apartment showed the same attention to stocking anything the guests could possibly need, from spare toothbrushes to big generous supplies of shampoo and conditioner.\nWe'd be very happy to stay here again when we're next in San Francisco... if all of Vera and Cléber's fans haven't booked it up first, that is."", 'This is truly one of the best experiences I’ve had at an Airbnb!

Easy!', ""This ranks highly as one of the best listings I've stayed at anywhere in the world for a business trip. Vera and Cléber have put in a great deal of thought to ensure that their guests have everything they could possibly need during their stay. They really have gone above and beyond in terms of what they make available for their guests. You could almost arrive with only the clothes on your back. But even if you took all that away (because it's a very nice to have but they shouldn't be expected to provide toiletries, food, bottled water etc.) this would be a fantastic stay. They are both very responsive, check-in was a breeze, and the apartment is super comfortable and very clean. 5/5 for everything. Hard to fault.\n(Yes you can hear the cars and street noise, and the movements of the upstairs neighbour a little now and then. But both to me were not to a level worth noting.

The place is super clean, spacious, and with thoughtful interiors, which made me feel relaxed after a busy work day. We appreciated the fully stocked kitchen and the host also welcomed us with bakery, extra towels, wine, drinks etc. The only nitpick is sometimes a bit of noise from the outside road, but that's not uncommon for the center of a busy city with walkability. Overall would highly recommend their place to other guests and would consider staying again."", 'Cleber and Vera were amazing. One of the best Hosting experiences I have had to date.

The host was incredibly kind and thoughtful during the check-in process, making me feel immediately at ease. The fridge was thoughtfully stocked with everything I could need. It was an amazing stay, and I couldn't recommend it more."", ""Phenomenal apartment, absolutely above average in every way. My partner and I stayed for 4 nights and lacked for nothing. Though Vera and Cléber's place was a little more expensive than we would shell out for, it was worth every penny. They were flexible and communicative and the amenities/welcome gifts were sensational. There was so much personality in the decor and none of the usual soulless cookie cutter and corporate air bnb crap. I appreciate that Vera and Cléber take so much care and put some heart and soul into their space. Other air bnb hosts please take notes from these two! This space is clearly so much more than just a smart investment, they truly care for this space and that makes all the difference. Thanks for a great stay."", ""This place and these Hosts are what Airbnb is all about! The space is peaceful and lovely - even though the building fronts a busy street, once inside, it's quiet in the courtyard. The loft is decorated beautifully with interesting objects to look at everywhere, and everything you need is provided - an assortment of teas and coffees, snacks, chocolates, bottled water, beer, juices, fruit... it's amazing.\nVera and Cléber are the consummate Hosts - they even asked ahead of time what kind of juice I liked and had it waiting. Cléber met me on arrival and walked me through the space to make sure I knew where everything was. And then he brought me a fresh papaya! They really do make this like a second home (except it's actually a much nicer home than my own). I would highly recommend to anyone visiting SF!"", 'Perfect place :)', 'I highly recommend Vera and Cléber’s loft to anyone visiting San Francisco. The location is convenient to much of the city and we never had trouble finding parking. There’s a Whole Foods store located two blocks away, an easy walk to get provisions.\nThe loft itself is a beautiful, light filled space. We love the kitchen and open living-room. The gas fireplace makes it perfectly cozy for cool San Francisco evenings. The king sized bed is very comfortable. Vera and Cléber thought of every detail to make us feel welcome and at home.', 'Wonderful host, unique place, and clean stay! I appreciated the stocked fridge and pantry, overall felt very luxurious.', 'We had the most lovely stay here. Cleber and Vera really go above and beyond to make sure you feel at home.

Thank you!', 'A magical place in a great location — walkable to Sightglass Coffee, Whole Foods and so much more. We arrived at 9:30pm and was met with Cléber whom helped us with our bags into the space. We received a thoughtful tour of the loft: How to use the fireplace, do\'s and don\'ts (everything was mostly do\'s, in the best way possible). The fridge and pantry is fully stocked. Chocolates and sweets all around the house. Fresh towels and many thoughtful amenities. Let me tell you—these hosts are the masters of hospitality.\nCléber then left us with a bottle of wine, a loaf of the best bread in San Francisco, and these words ""please use anything and everything in this place, but just don\'t break my soul, its the only thing I actually own in this life, you can reach me 24/7—do not hesitate to call"".\nI\'d give more stars if I could.', 'So I will start this review with the ""bad"", which has nothing to do with the host, and the host acknowledges this. The outside of the building does look somewhat dated but that is about all the ""bad"" with this listing. At no time despite looking dated did we feel unsafe walking outside in the neighborhood. We were met by our host when we arrived (check in is at 2pm which is great). The host gave us a very thorough tour of the property and the home, showing us all the features along with helping us figure our way around the city. The unit pictures do not do it justice. I do need to point out that this is not a kid friendly unit, which for our trip was something my wife and I were looking for.\nBoth whole foods and trader Joes are a couple of blocks away which made food shopping easy. Union square was also about 10 minutes walk which meant we did not have to have any rented cars, and got by either by public transit, uber/lyft or just plain old walking.\nAll in all I have to say that this ranks among my top 3 airbnb units that I have had the good fortune of having rented. I highly recommend this unit if you are traveling to SF and looking for a non kid friendly central location', 'Wonderful stay! Hosts went above and beyond to make my stay comfortable and easy.', 'Amazing host and place to stay in. The hosts went above and beyond making us feel comfortable.', 'Pros:\nVery responsive host, accommodating when I got there even earlier than I said I would, before standard checkin time. Place is very clean. Great hospitality, and the host was very thoughtful and provided snacks and drinks, all the conveniences you would need, and was truly available 24/7. One of the best hosts I’ve stayed with.\nCons:\nNoisy due to street noise, the freeway, and the upstairs neighbor seemed to be pretty active in the evenings. I visited when a political conference was nearby and the area was, by all accounts, cleaned up considerably vs normal in terms of people living on the street outside, but I did still run into what you’d expect in this part of San Francisco. What I’d like to call out that I didn’t see in other reviews was that going up to the bed and sleeping area required going up VERY steep, winding stairs. Some of them are quite narrow and I nearly hurt myself several times. The shower, which is also upstairs, is very narrow.', ""Words can hardly do justice to the love and care that Cleber and Vera put into making this place a home. Not only it delivers on absolutely all the basics such as accessibility, cleanliness, great location, well equipped for long term stays, and all the modern amenities, but what stands out is how responsive and accommodative the hosts are. I can truly say that I found a great friend in Cleber. Spending time with him and seeing SF from his eyes was the definite highlight of my trip and I will always choose their place whenever I am back in the city. Thank you Cleber for being my friend in an unknown city, for being the kindest person I've ever met, and for welcoming me into your home!"", ""This was the best equipped and stocked Air B&B we have stayed at (anything we thought we might need we found and my measure of attention to detail, sharp knives).

They were super hospitable, they paid a lot of attention to details in the house, and they're very responsive when I asked them questions. There's also free street parking nearby and it's pretty much always possible to find a spot.\nOnly caveat is that the place isn't exactly quiet -- it's next to a rather busy street, and the floorboards are quite thin so you can hear footsteps from upstairs. But Cleber was very proactive in resolving these issues and reached out to the neighbors for us."", 'Wonderful place!', ""I've stayed at about 30 Airbnbs and this is one of the best. The loft is huge, quiet, and comfortable. But what really sets this place apart is the attention Vera & Cleber put into appointing it. The house is stocked with everything you might need, down to details I have never seen other Airbnb hosts think through. You will have everything you might need in this house, and it will be clean, fresh, abundant, and of excellent quality.

We are both lawyers and by nature skeptical and cautious. When we arrived at Cleber’s and Vera’s home we were very pleasantly surprised at how CLEAN (eat of the floor clean!) the apt was and the level of hospitality that was extended to us. Vera had emailed ahead of time to find out what beverages we liked — when we arrived there was fresh squeezed OJ, two kinds of milk as well as sparking and flat water and wine! She also stocked the Re fridge with cured meats, cheese, butter and fruit. We went directly to the office when we arrived and were so tired when we went back we were grateful for fresh sour dough bread to eat and fruit for our late tired dinner. We loved being there and very much appreciated all of the thoughtful details that they did to make us feel at home and welcome. I am admitted hard to please and I was very pleased and will return any time we can get ourselves to SF. We will also recommend their place to our UES friends who are equally discerning and caring.

The efficiency suite is a good size for two people who plan on spending the day out and about and want a cozy room to come back to for a warm cup of tea or coffee in the evenings. The kitchen was perfect for little breakfasts and a warm cup of tea before and after a sunny but chilly day in the city. The space heater was so nice, and the shower is excellent.

It's a small space but very well-appointed with a kitchenette and a surprisingly big bathroom with a great shower. Basics like coffee and soap were all provided as well as some complimentary snacks. Private entrance and easy check-in/out with keypad locks. It was just me, so the futon situation was fine. I made it a couch in the morning and a bed at night. Pretty comfortable (and I've slept on some terrible futons). As far as a work space, there is a desk area but it's not somewhere you'd want to work for very long if you value your back.

Would stay again."", ""Yana was a wonderful host and the Airbnb was absolutely perfect for our needs, as we were out and about for most of the day and came back to the place to relax and get a good night's sleep for another fun day.

It's also located in a safe neighborhood and only a ~10 minute walk to countless restaurants and bars.

Kristiina's detailed info was very much appreciated and spot-on. A few things to know:\n1) I never felt unsafe heading to/from the Bart station and I'm a solo female traveler. I can see how someone who has never experienced life in a large city might have reservations, but the blocks directly around the AirBnB felt like a pretty normal neighborhood to me. Dog park across the street gets good use from locals, which is nice!\n2) Kristiina's descriptions mention the possibility of noise. I kept a window open during my stay and you do hear highway traffic that way, but it was more of a white-noise backdrop that helped me get my work done. The street itself is very quiet and I only heard other guests when they came in or out (this room is just off the front entrance; for me, the door noise was a totally acceptable trade-off for the lovely private bathroom!).\n3) Loved the closet nook, very handy.

The main problem was mold in the bathroom - both visible stains and a very strong smell. We reported this to the host, who was not surprised and had no problems with canceling the accommodation and fully refunding - I can only guess that this is not the first such situation. It's a pity, because the place, despite its small size, would be acceptable for one night while traveling, with a pretty good location. A big plus for responsiveness and a very kind conversation despite the situation."", 'nice place as described would stay again', 'Exactly what we needed and more for our day trip to San Fran.

In other words, we had the best of all worlds. I loved that our apartment was at the back of the house...so there was no street noise...and easy access to the garden. If it's available, I'd highly recommend renting the garage space. It just added peace of mind, as it relates to street cleaning and vandalism. GG Park is one of the most amazing places in SF!

It's not a luxurious place but comes with all the basics, as well as some thoughtful extras, such as water bottles and snacks.\nI would warn light sleepers, however, that sound from the apartment upstairs can be very loud. We could hear a young child talking most nights, which I found charming. But we stayed for a week, and two nights the child ran back and forth across the floor, jumping, stomping, and stampeding until midnight. We were amazed at how loud it was.

That’s the only caveat, if you plan on using ride-share services, it is a few miles from some of the more popular parts of SF, so the Ubers will be on the expensive side.

We stayed here with our 8 month old, and found it so helpful to have toys, pack & play, a mobile high chair, and a backyard.

The local area was very convenient, featuring a nice market with a wide selection of groceries, and chain grocery stores, restaurants, and other attractions were all within walking distance. The house is also situated next to a large, beautiful park, which we explored with our host and their wonderful dog, Mack.

There were plenty of supplies for our stay.\nOur only concerns were the Uber drivers couldn’t find us a couple of times, and there was a homeless person sleeping across the street. We couldn’t get our car in the garage, our car is a low sports car, otherwise it would have fit. We were nervous about taking the public transportation because of the steep streets to get there and back.\nThere’s ample parking on the street.

As all the other reviews say the main bed is very comfortable.', 'Keri’s place was excellent. Simple studio with access to all of the essentials including kitchenette (outside of main sleeping/living area) and laundry facilities. The neighborhood is good for taking walks and runs with a cool park nearby. Public transit was a little bit out of the way, but I think that’s the case for most places in SF. The studio is also in the back so it feels very private which I appreciated as a solo female traveler.\nKeri made sure to message me after I checked in to make sure I had everything I needed.

Close enough to get everywhere in San Francisco within 15-20 minutes and away from everything that you wouldn’t want to be around. The view was very nice in the backyard.

When I come back, hopefully this little gem will be available', 'Keri’s place is a delightful oasis of tranquility in the hustle and bustle of San Francisco. Definitely recommend it. Her place was spotless and cozy. Would stay here again.', 'Had a lovely stay! Bernal Heights is an adorable neighborhood with cute houses, cool gardens, and those classic hilly streets.

The neighbors are friendly and welcoming if you run in to them. Keri was very accommodating and the AirBnB had everything we needed. The kitchenette was in the garage area but we didn't use it much. If you're unfamiliar with San Francisco, do note that a lot of streets are a tight fit if you're driving throughout the city. This also goes for residential areas and even the garage parking that's included in this listing. I drove my Nissan Versa Note and fit snuggly in the garage.

Once inside, the apartment was lovely. The bathroom was nice for two people: roomy, with space around the sink to hold all personal items, and two hooks for towels. Shower was hot and had good pressure. The booklet Keri left provided clear info about wifi, amenities, check-out expectations, and offered local dining recommendations. We enjoyed 2 breakfasts at Precitia Park Cafe, and walking around the neighborhood. On our last day, one neighbor encouraged us to come to the October block party, and another told us about wildlife on Bernal Hill. Very friendly and welcoming. We got around by walking, using MUNI & BART, and Lyft. I'd stay here again."", 'Such a perfect little spot for our weekend in SF. It was exactly what we needed!

The highchair isn’t suitable for very little babies just learning to eat, as it’s not very wipe-friendly, is tilted back and has no straps. If your little ones aren’t yet safe around stairs, please note there are steep exposed stairs to the back yard. Bring your own tableware for kids, there’s only adult glassware and silverware (but thank you Sid for finding us some disposable plates and forks and spoons to make do!)\nThe kitchen isn’t set up for cooking really but fine for breakfast. We all\nSlept great here and it worked out!', 'Sid is an amazing host! Me and my family took a trip to SF for Christmas 2023, and we stayed at Sid’s place. She was very kind and helpful, and even allowed us to use her infant car seat a couple days after our check-out.

He also came by to greet and the place was so cute and adorable and had everything you needed. Id highly recommend!', ""We had a wonderful stay with Sid! It's a wonderful space, and the garden access is a definite highlight. The space was clean, spacious, welcoming, and close to public transportation (BART).

Very close to the BART', 'Sid and Lena’s place was a great choice for our family’s California vacation as we planned to drive down the coast. We flew in from NJ, rented a vehicle - the Airbnb was a short drive from the airport/car rental site. We stayed for 3 nights and our experience was truly amazing. We visited Canyon Market, Golden Gate Bridge/Park where we rented a Surrey, Tiburon/ Angel Island where we took the Ferry to the Island and then a Trolley Tour of the Island- we got to see seals just chilling on the docks, San Francisco’s China Town where we got the best Chinese Food, Fishermen’s Wharf where we got In/Out burgers because they don’t have that in NJ, Palace of Fine Arts, Coit Tower and Baker Beach where we saw a beautiful sunset. Coming Back to the Airbnb each night felt like Home Sweet Home. Sid and Lena’s place was clean, comfortable and relaxing.

It’s a safe neighborhood within proximity of many transit lines and freeways. Highly recommend and look forward to staying again!', ""Lovely stay at Sid and Lena's place! It was a great spot to stay with a kid- the backyard is pretty and quiet, and it's a short walk to Cayuga Playground a few blocks away. Super easy to get to transit.

Also really enjoyed the private veranda.', 'Overall it was a great experience and air b&b. My wife & I had a great time and we felt at home. The place is extremely clean it has everything you need inside exactly like how she describes it. The only downside was our experience with finding somewhere to park. We were looking for a spot to park our vehicle for 45 min since it was street cleaning the following day. But overall the host is very communicative and responds fairly quick & I don’t have any complaints about the host. We highly recommend 68 Rome!\nThank you Sid!', 'Sid’s place is really beautiful!

I definitely stay here again next time.', 'Sid and Olena were very communicative and welcoming. Wonderful home and proximity to businesses, would come back again.', 'As everyone knows San Francisco is very crowd city , you can say house by house and car by car. We rented a 7 seats truck for the trip most of time can’t find parking. The day we went home late and we parked in front of Sid’s house and I texted him at 9:30pm -“please check see if you have enough space to move your car” and he texted me back right away saying “yes”. On that moment I can feel the they care about us. I worte this is for their humanistic care. Also very nice place to stay and comfortable. We will choose here again.', 'The Airbnb was quite good. It has all the amenities we needed. The host was quite responsive to our needs and queries. The only issue we faced with not having an assigned parking spot which made parking on the streets a little challenging.', 'Sid was a great host. He let us check in earlier without an issue. Also accessing to the AirBnB was easy. The patio is an excellent option to be outside and enjoy. Definitely would stay again.', ""Upon our arrival, we were surprised to find a crowded house and entered through the tenant's garage into a spacious bedroom suite. Despite being advertised as private, there was a mattress blocking the staircase to the upstairs home. The living area appeared larger in photos than in reality, and parking was scarce in the area. We ended up using Uber for transportation throughout the weekend after finding a spot on the street and not wanting to move our car. On a positive note, the garden area was beautiful and relaxing, giving off city vibes. I would recommend this place to a single traveler on an overnight work trip. Many of the locations mentioned in the description were not within walking distance but were a short 5-minute Uber ride away."", 'Sid was incredibly friendly and accommodating when I asked for early luggage drop off and late luggage pick up. The house was lovely. The neighborhood was quiet and safe; the neighbors were also friendly. Great stay!', 'Sid was very helpful and thorough with instructions. The airbnb is the lower level to a 2 level home. We felt like we did have good privacy. This place was very easy to find, and we had no issues during our stay. Place is comfy and clean. I love that we had private access to a beautiful courtyard in the back. The courtyard has such a beautiful view. Parking can be hard to find, since you will be parking on the street. We did get lucky and got to park close to the house. Neighborhood was very quiet and feels safe.']",['3 guests · 1 bedroom · 1 bed · 1 bath']

The bed was comfortable, and we felt pretty private! We would stay here again for a longer stay!

Also, you can hear the folks above you walking and listening to music. Still, it is a great space, the price was reasonable, and you can walk to a few cute neighborhoods in 15-30 minutes."", 'Great neighbor and public transportation was very abundant!

Clean, comfortable and east to access.', 'Great host and great place. Thank you for the hospitality.', 'I enjoyed my stay overall! I was pleasantly surprised with the location for shopping & good restaurants in the area.\nOnly complaints would be how loud the people upstairs/their dog are. I was napping after a long morning of exploring and was awoken a couple of times.\nLast thing being the signal is pretty bad there. My Verizon & T-Mobile phones were both on SOS while I was there so I had to rely heavily on their not so great WiFi. I tried to get an early check in and never got a response but eventually the owner said they granted me the early check in but the message never fully sent to me (probably because of the signal issue I assume)\nSo I ended up just sitting at a coffee shop for 2 hours which was a bit annoying.', '10/10 would recommend Josh’s place.

Good area of the city.', ""We loved the suite and Josh was a great host. The unit was VERY clean and was exactly what we expected when we arrived. Josh also let us drop our bags off early so we could enjoy the city for the day without worrying about our luggage. We did not realize how quaint the Courtland Ave area of Bernal Heights was and we wish we would have found that and explored that area more.\nWhat we did not love was how long it took to get to the big city area. If taking the public transit (Muni) it was only $2.50 per trip but took at least 45 minutes to get to or from the city, sometimes longer. If taking Uber, it was $20-30 per trip but only 20-25 minutes. Being on the south side of town, most tourist/fun attractions are on the opposite side of the city. We knew this ahead of time but didn't realize would take so long to get there. Renting a car is an option but there are few parking options in the city and paid parking would get a little more expensive."", 'Had a lovely time at Candace and Joshua’s apartment!

Loved the big walk in shower. Was able to hear some faint but beautiful violin music coming from upstairs at one point (a plus for us), but there was also a white noise machine available for folks who don’t want to listen.

I could not recommend this place enough.\n- Location was just great, right close to everything within and considerable driving distance. (I’d say 20 to 30min from main places to visit). It is also within walking distance (8 to 10 min) to some places for breakfast, and a great place recommended by Emily calles Lucho’s for breakfast/brunch.\n- The apartment was crystal clean, just like on the listing, and even when we didn’t have to use some of the appliances it had everything you need for your family.

One of the best I had the pleasure to interact with, communication was great and very quick to respond. She was so considerate that allowed us to check in earlier and check out later.

This rental has everything you might want and more. The area is so quiet you forget you’re in a city. The sunrise views from the deck are incredible.

Susan was a very communicative host and greeted me upon arrival but then let me be. It’s an ideal weekend escape and quite walkable for the hale and hearty.

She allowed us to check in early and for some family to visit. Her place is a gem. A true find. She even had treats from local bakery that a tired traveler always needs.

The neighborhood is a cute clean, San Francisco residential neighborhood with cafes and restaurants in walking distance. Try Noe valley bakeru', 'Great stay! Susan was very responsive and helpful. Neighborhood was so peaceful and quiet. Walking distance to 24th street with tons of fun stores and restaurants.', 'Susan’s place was lovely! The decor was so nice, it was spacious and spotless, and the local treats were a special touch. Lots of little stairs and steps so if you had any mobility issues it wouldn’t be a good choice (I didn’t see that listed anywhere on the Airbnb description so wanted to point it out, wasn’t an issue for us). We were so sad to only be staying a short time - the neighborhood was cute and we would have loved to explore even more. We met Susan on our way out and she was very nice and a gracious host!

We loved our stay here and hope to visit again!', 'Ubaldo and Krista were extremely gracious hosts and the flat far exceeded my expectations! It’s safe to say it was among the nicest Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in. We were very comfortable and made ourselves right at home.

San Francisco can get pretty chilly in January but we felt toasty and warm. The apartment is impeccably decorated in mid century furniture and decor and the linens and bedding were also so soft and comfortable. They provided plenty creature comforts like towels and linens, and offered an array of coffee makers to choose from (we’re French press fans).

I travel to San Francisco several times a year and look forward to staying here again!', 'Great apartment! We stayed with our family while in town for a wedding.

Everything from booking to check out was so easy and well thought out. The host (who was extremely friendly) was there to walk us through it all as well as any additional needs we had.

It had beautiful new furnishings, was clean, had two nice size bedrooms, and all the items one might need during a stay.

It was so close to restaurants, bars and the walking path along Chrissy Fields that travels all the way to the GG Bridge. The best part of our stay was Ubaldo being so friendly and helpful as he gave us many tips as to where to eat and things to do close by. It was raining a good part of our stay, right after Christmas, so we stayed inside a little more than we planned. We were so happy to have such a pretty place to stay.

Being close to many transit stops made getting around a breeze.\nBut the true highlight of my stay was Krista herself. You can tell she truly enjoys hosting!

The essence of their personalities warmed me up from the beginning. These two really take care of their property and their guests. For example, the new toaster went out (it looked brand new) and Krista had it replaced same day.\nThe experience was amazing and if you want to be close to the bridge, Marina or triangle area, this is a good spot. It reminded me of an upscaled apartment I had always dreamed of staying in when I was in my 20s and going to school at SFSU. The bed was super comfy, and the space overall warm and inviting.\nMy only suggestion is if you are unable to walk or struggling to get up stairs, the stairs of this place might be a bit much for you.\nMy wife and I have stayed in a variety of AirBNB locations and this one is top notch and we will be reserving a spot again soon for a weekend away. - Gary and Jennifer Harris"", 'Spent a week in San Francisco following a surgical procedure and was fortunate enough to book Ubaldo & Krista’s home for our time there.

The front door and the room all have a code lock, so no keys to carry around. The house has three rooms, all clearly marked and independent. There is also a laundry room, but I didn\'t use it.

Also loved the private entrance through the garage. Would definitely stay there again.', 'Our stay was great, we had everything we needed. Good location - safe and quiet.

The room was very clean and the house is located in a nice neighborhood.', ""Everything positive that has been said about this place by other reviewers holds true; it's indeed a good spot in SF with a comfortable room (and especially bed) and our stay was quite pleasant as well.\nHowever, there are a few areas for improvement. Firstly, the check-out time is early at 10am, and check-in isn't until 4pm; more convenient times would be check-out at 11am or later, and check-in at 3pm or earlier. Secondly, the bathtub is quite high, so adding a handle or grip bar inside the shower would be beneficial. Additionally, the armoire has limited space for hanging clothes due to the presence of blankets, and the absence of an iron and ironing board might be an inconvenience for longer stays. Also, the area is hilly, which could be challenging for those uncomfortable with inclines or facing accessibility issues. Lastly, the room has limited natural light due to a small window."", 'Very good place oara stay and safe, but a little removed the access to the metro.

Super kind and organized hosts.', ""Hai Lin's place is clean, as described, and overall as expected. It was easy to find and check in was smooth. The first morning of my stay, the lock on my door stopped working and I was unable to enter the room for ~2 hours.

Only the furniture and the condition of the patio and the garden want a little more attention. For example, we kept the handle of the front door in our hands on the 2nd day when opening.

We loved going to Sutro Park to watch the sunset and hiking the Lands End trail around to the Legion of Honor--such gorgeous views of the Golden Gate Bridge. What a splendid location! One of us attended a conference downtown, taking the Geary 38R bus there and back--an easy commute. As for amenities: The WiFi is fast; the bed comfy and the covers warm; the shower was superb; and the kitchenette has all the basics needed to keep you well fed if you want to eat in. There's a Safeway a 20-minute walk or short bus ride away, and the Geary Grocery Outlet is a must-visit at the corner of 28th Ave if you want excellent wines at bargain prices.

Otherwise, if you want a cosy well-priced location to explore San Francisco in one of the best parts of the city (in my opinion), this is a fantastic place for a couple or single person. If you're used to tight spaces, it also sleeps a third comfortably. Both the bed and the sofa bed were very comfortable (according to my teenage son who slept on the sofa bed).\nLast thought: if you like to eat at home, this place works well for a couple, but is tight for any more than that. Fortunately you're in San Fran and there's an endless plethora of options for eating out!"", 'Great stay. Neighborhood is safe. Close to scenic walking trails.

The bed was quite comfortable and the bedroom was good sized. For a 10-day stay though, we would have liked to have had a dresser so we could unpack our clothes. The apartment layout was pretty standard for that part of SF. If you're used to narrow hallways, quirky half steps up into the bathroom, locked doors leading into the rest of the house, and having no windows except on one wall, you'll do fine. We found the couch pretty uncomfortable. It might be all right for shorter stays but it wasn't the best for a longer stay while I was recovering from surgery.

We walked to the beach (4 blocks), coffee (“Trouble”, psst no decaf!), groceries (Co-Op), restaurants (“Java Beach” for picnic sandwiches), bike shop (“Swell” rentals), and Muni light rail to go into town ($2.75). This rental was spotlessly clean, pictures are accurate and had everything we needed. Host had thoughtfully left a bottle of Prosecco and chocolate for our anniversary! Also, very kindly, 2 face masks due to poor air quality from the fires. Wi-Fi was great, towels plush, water hot, bed firm and comfortable and I appreciated having a big fat empty shelf to put stuff on in the bathroom.

I was initially worried about distance to common attractions, however there were ALWAYS Ubers within 5 minutes away. Wonderful to walk just a few blocks to Golden Gate Park (gorgeous and so many things to enjoy), Ocean Beach, Lands End trails, Sutro Trails, grocery store, laundromat, Walgreens and countless dining establishments. Patio very relaxing with ocean view and could hear the waves any\ntime of day. So serene and relaxing. And Outer Richmond is more slow paced with minimal traffic. I met a young lady whom has lived in SF for 10 yrs with last 5 yrs being down the street from Airbnb. She & fiancé wanting to move to larger place but adamant about staying in Outer Richmond because they live the calming vibe of the area, feeling safe and how close everything is. Will definitely stay at Cranson’s if in SF again.', ""Cranson and Claudia's place was perfect for our 5 day stay. They were great hosts and provided us with everything we needed. The entire living space was spotless and the access to the patio with views of the ocean was a huge bonus. The large kitchen was perfect for cooking breakfast or dinner.

Easily walkable to the beach, Golden Gate Park, Land's End Trail and to some great markets and restaurants on Balboa."", 'This unit is just as advertised, but a little better. Ingress and egress were simple. The space was clean and nicely laid out. It was quiet and private. The view of Ocean Beach was wonderful and the backyard space was a welcoming place to just sit and relax. The beach is close and a great place to stroll, and so is Golden Gate Park. Perhaps most impressive, however, was how the hosts had anticipated our every need. Every detail had been considered. I would definitely recommend this place for a visit to the quieter side of San Francisco.', ""Cranson is a great host! It was my best Airbnb experience ever.

The location was very convenient. We would leave early in the day and would get back at night after spending time with our new grandson. We felt safe walking in the area and when we would get back in the evening, it was quiet and comfortable. There was plenty of room to unpack our bags, the walk-in closet is a huge plus. I am also sensitive to fragrances, and I appreciated the fact that the space was not scented. Also, the cleaning supplies and hand soap were skin friendly.

The space was clean and had nice features like space heaters (a must for late May in SF), comfortable bed, and large kitchenette. The location--blocks from Golden Gate Park, Ocean Beach, Sutro Heights, and Land's End--made for a fun day of exploring by foot. We didn't have a car, but we found tourist spots like Fisherman's Wharf reasonably accessible by Uber, public bus (though buses are pretty slow--check out BART Trip Planner), and some determined hill-climbing on foot. For travelers with a car, the apartment has off-street parking in front of the house.\nCranson himself had great communication, was friendly but not intrusive, and provided excellent travel information.

It\'s a great place for cooking (which we did), and for just hanging out (which we also did), and we felt like our car was totally safe in the driveway. One thing to note: the owner lives above this rental space on the second floor -- but they are super-quiet! We barely heard anything except people walking around a few times.

Our teenager slept on the foldout couch. Kitchen was well stocked with oil, spices, and they even left some goodies, drinks etc as a welcome gift. Plenty of towels, high pressure shower. It is in an ideal location to walk to the coastal trail and Golden Gate Park - we had rented a small car to drive into the city.

Nice to have parking included.', 'This is probably the best AirBnB we’ve stayed at (and we’ve stayed at many). Cranson and Claudia’s attention to detail was incredible. They anticipate every need. The stocked amenities exceeded anything we’ve experienced. The space is super quiet for: 1) being in the city; and 2) being occupied upstairs. The location is about 6 blocks from the ocean and great hiking. The space is immaculately clean and comfortable. Im not sure what was better - the mattress or the shower, but both were perfect. There are wonderful restaurants in walking distance. We were just far enough west to feel secluded, but close enough that Lyft rides to the more touristy parts of SF were affordable.

I've never seen this in an Airbnb before, and it was a great addition. we highly recommend this place to stay if you want to be away from the hustle of downtown, but also very near the ocean, Golden Gate park, and Sutro Park."", 'Do you remember back in the old days of AirBNB when it was like staying at a family member’s house?

It's number one on my list for next time we come."", ""My boyfriend and I are SF locals (downtown), but just wanted to be close to the beach and the parks for a quiet little getaway and Cranson's place couldn't have been more perfect. We enjoyed mornings outside on the patio, and the super short walks to the beach, Golden Gate Park and Lands End. Cranson was super responsive when we needed assistance a couple times and we really appreciated how clean the place was along with the added touches of sanitizer, cleaning wipes and mask packs due to the current pandemic.

Ocean Beach, Lands End, Sutro Heights, and Golden Gate park are within walking distance and make for great day time strolls. You could spend every day walking around the surrounding area and not get bored! The street is a little steep, which could be an issue for some.

Although I know my way around the city, I can assure any guest from out of town that you have a *true* local expert and San Francisco native in this host. He also strikes the perfect balance of being communicative and available, without being intrusive. Arrival and checkout instructions are clear and simple. There are so many thoughtful, personal touches throughout the unit and everything was sparkling clean. Not to mention the serene, private garden, ocean view and very easy access to some of the best coastline on the Pacific. Wonderful hiking, loads of great dining options and plenty to explore and experience...even for this local girl. I would love to book this place again and make it an annual ritual. This part of San Francisco is one of the top destinations in the world!', 'The place seemed nicer than it looked in the photos. Great back yard. I loved that both sides of the bed had tables and lights for reading. Lots of conveniently placed hooks and towel racks.', 'Such a beautiful district and Cranston & Claudia’s home is charming, quaint and a safe haven return for all of our daily adventures.

From watching the sunset, listening to the waves at night and doing my daily stretches outside on their patio - not to mention in the cold air and under the full moon.\nEasy walking distance to the stores (Safeway/Walgreens), coffee shops, restaurants (Chinese restaurants), hiking spots (lands end, mile rock, Golden Gate Park) and the beach. Greeted on some days by their loving cat(s). I wish I got a chance to meet them but they are incredibly responsive and there is all-around privacy.\nI would highly recommend this place to future guests or those looking for a stay. Especially because they have parking on site. We had a smaller SUV. *Remember, San Francisco has random days for cleaning their streets and at random hours. If you don’t want to deal with that, stay here. Thank you both!', 'This Airbnb was perfect for us. So clean and comfortable with an awesome porch and view of the ocean. We enjoyed our stay very much. There was so much info and amenities. It felt like home. Thank you!', 'Due to the very small bathroom and lack of a dining table, this apartment is better suited for one person. I also thought the furniture could stand some updating. As I did not spend much time in the apartment, I only took advantage of the coffee maker in the kitchen. The back yard looked nice, but due to the weather conditions, I did not have a chance to explore it. A plus was the comfortable queen size bed and nice shower.', ""I had a relaxing stay at Cranson and Claudia's place. I especially enjoyed the outdoor patio. Cranson is very quick to respond when I had questions. The space has labels and a handy binder that makes it easy to find what you need during your stay.\nI'm familiar with the Outer Richmond neighborhood and like how quiet it is. It may be a bit far for some who want to be near more tourist-oriented sights and shopping/dining areas, but not those who want quick access to the coastal trails and beaches. They are only a few blocks away.\nNever have I stayed at an Airbnb that was as thoughtfully prepared for guests as Cranson and Claudia's place. They've really thought of everything, and are most certainly premier SUPERhosts!"", 'Cranson has thought of everything! His clear instructions and the book of local information was great.

I appreciate the easy street parking, closeness (but not too close!) to the freeway, and comfortable bed/bedding. Decor/amenities are minimal, but on-site kitchen and laundry are a plus.\nOn par with a hotel room, but slightly better value: slightly less privacy, shared bathroom and minor morning noise in common space, but lower cost and more convenient, saving the hassle of parking in the inner city and avoiding sketchy areas (Mission) where all the affordable hotels are located.', 'Jian was extremely responsive whenever we needed anything! He was present and extremely friendly to us and all of his guests! Would definitely come back again.', 'I stayed at Jian’s place for a weekend and everything went smoothly! The check in directions are flawless and the room is exactly as described (the view is great).

He responded very quickly and helped us with everything. He has a folder with recommendations for SF. The accommodation is more like a hostel. You share bathroom and kitchen with other rooms (5 in total, 2 kitchens & bathrooms). The kitchen had basic equipment but was dirty. There was no coffee machine only instant coffee but a few other things were available for everyone. Washing machine and dryer were available and free (except times for housekeeping). In general the floors were a bit dirty and there were a few ants. Also we couldn’t manage the heat/cold in our room and it was mostly either hot or rather cold due to the ventilation.\nSometimes the environment was a little bit noisy but in general it was fine. Parking was a little bit difficult because the one spot in front of the house was always occupied and to find a spot on the street wasn’t always possible. All in all it was a good value for the price and Jian Hui is a very friendly host!']",['1 double bed · Shared bathroom']

You have to park your bike outside somewhere if you ride a bike but it\'s a really safe neighborhood. I say ""not walkable"" but there\'s a great store on the corner and lots of restaurants nearby.

What was not so good was the kitchen ceiling started leaking on the fourth night I was there (it was raining). I put a trash bin under the leak to catch the water and used a towel to soak up the puddle of water from the floor. Before I rented the unit, I was informed that the ceiling had leaked before but was repaired, apparently the repair didn't last, as water leaked from the repaired area too. I informed Mark and Sarah and they apologized for the leak but other than that they didn't offer any compensation or discount. I didn't ask for any either, so I'm not sure if they will or won't. Honestly, I'm not sure what the protocol is for events like this. It would have been nice if they had offered something for my trouble,oh well."", 'Thank you Mark and Sarah!

Looks just like photos (including glorious garden). Near the J muni and fantastic coffee shop + restaurants. One note for guests sleeping in both beds— the bathroom is inside the main bedroom and has a smoked glass window between bedroom and bath, but there are plenty small nightlights so one doesn’t need to turn on the bathroom light in middle of the night. The couch bed isn’t too bad but not super supportive. I’d definitely stay again (tho maybe not with two people not sleeping in the same main bedroom!). Thank you Jana and Geof!', 'Lovely elegant unit with gorgeous art deco furniture and great overall design. Comfortable, peaceful, and private. Garden access and French doors to daylight a treasure! Owners very thoughtful and instantly responsive. Easy access to Mission district, restaurants and Lyft rides reasonable everywhere from its central location.', 'The back garden is lovely.

I hope to visit again!!', 'Jana and Geof were wonderful hosts and couldn’t be kinder! While the kitchen does not have a dishwasher nor stove/oven, they have a one pot burner, microwave, and fancy toaster/bake oven. We didn’t need any thing more. And the kitchen was fully furnished plus had a pantry full of oils and spices. Very thoughtful touches.\nThe most impressive part of the apt was an amazing garden in back, which both the bedroom and living room opened up to. Just gorgeous!\nWe highly recommend this apt and look forward to visiting here again soon.', ""We only stayed for a couple of days, but Jana Geof's place was a great choice. The location was close to friends and within walking distance of many amenities. Public transport was extremely close by, so even though it wasn't close to downtown, it was very easy to get there for a day of exploring. Jana and Geof's home was quintessential San Francisco! The garden-level unit was small, but efficient, with everything we needed for our short stay. I was able to sit out on the small patio in the morning to drink my coffee and enjoy the lovely garden, the bed was very comfortable and the kitchenette had everything we needed. We didn't prepare any meals, but the coffee maker, fridge, and sink were more than adequate for our needs. Our local friends were excited to learn there was an Airbnb just around the corner for the future when other friends and family come to the city. We would definitely recommend it."", 'We enjoyed our stay at Jana & Geof’s! We especially loved the lush privacy of the back garden.

Easy to use public transportation from this location, and lots of things within walking distance as well, including grocery stores and the BART line to the airport (all about a 15 minute walk or less). We did rent a car for one day of our trip, and the hosts were very accommodating in helping us figure out parking (street parking only, with some time restrictions). This was a wonderful retreat from the bustle of SF, and Noe Valley is a charming and safe area.', 'We had a wonderful stay at Jana and Geof’s place. It was in the perfect location - quiet and peaceful but a short walk away from great local cafe’s and restaurants. We met Geof, who was a friendly and gracious host.

Would recommend to others."", 'Great hosts.', 'Beautiful place! Even more beautiful than the pictures. You can tell the hosts have put a lot of thought and care into the place. Bed is extremely comfy, garden is exquisite, shower is warm, decor is beautiful and kitchen is well stocked with utensils. Only thing I had slight reservations about was that the hosts ask you to not lock the door to the unit which is accessible from the house which can feel a little unsettling as a solo traveler. I felt better about it after meeting the hosts as they were extremely kind and welcoming.', 'Perfect apartment; perfect hosts! We spent a wonderful 10 days in this beautiful apartment, relishing not only the interior but also a delightful terrace leading into a gorgeous garden. We had breakfast on the terrace most mornings, which set us up well for the day. Our hosts, Jana and Geof, were so friendly and helpful.

This place is truly a gem snd we hope to stay here again when visiting our daughter and future son in law.', ""This apartment was WONDERFUL! It is perfectly set up even for a long stay rental. Squeaky clean, sturdy handrails for the steps (my husband liked), easy in and out access. The backyard is AMAZING. We spent most of our time at our son's house but if you were renting this apt for work and knew no one, you could easily have a stay-vacation in it!"", 'We have stayed in many airbnbs both in the US and abroad and I would say this is one of the nicest. The photos don’t do it justice and the rooms are bigger than in the photos. The bathroom and shower are both spacious with plenty of room for my toiletries. The garden is gorgeous and made us feel like we were staying in an Italian villa. I love morning coffee and was glad there was a regular coffee maker with Peet’s in the fridge. The bed was a bit softer than we like but still comfy. Nice restaurants about ten min walk away with cafes for morning baked treats only a few min away. The owners live upstairs and we could hear them walking around but it wasn’t that big a deal. We plan to come back to Noe Valley in June and will definitely stay here again!', 'This apartment is truly stunning and in a great location.

Thank you for sharing with us!', 'Jana and Geof we’re a great house. They were able to help me get some Amazon packages that were delivered for the purpose of my trip.\nAs well, these two made me feel very safe at their location as I was travelling without my family this time and so it was nice to be in a facility that was private, but yet the neighbours were very close', 'The place was exactly as described and depicted!

Large, fluffy towels and endless hot water! The home has everything you might need, especially in the kitchen. Washer and dryer were a blessing! Easy parking and there’s an awesome market in town. Hiking downtown is a memorable walk with the views.\nWe all loved our time having the floating home for our haven.\nThe world needs more folks like Lois and Bob. You 2 are awesome.', ""If you're looking for a serene escape that feels worlds away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life, look no further than Lois’s enchanting houseboat in Sausalito.\nFrom the moment I stepped aboard, I was captivated by the charm and character of this unique accommodation. The interior is beautifully decorated with cozy furnishings, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere.\nThe amenities provided exceeded my expectations, with a fully-equipped kitchen, washer and dryer and comfortable beds. The bathroom is small as you would expect, but manageable.\nBut perhaps the best part of my experience was the hospitality of the hosts, who went above and beyond to ensure that my stay was nothing short of perfect. From the moment I made my reservation to the day of my departure, they were attentive, responsive, and genuinely committed to making sure that I had a wonderful experience.\nMy recent stay here was nothing short of magical, offering much-needed tranquility."", ""This little houseboat captured our hearts. Well taken care of, takes advantage of being on the water with kayaks, unobstructed views of the water and the sanctuary-like bird activity right in front of the houseboat. Everything worked as needed pretty much as they do on land. We had a memorable Mother's Day dinner on the top deck. The beds were comfortable and clean. The kitchen was well equipped and easy to work in.\nLois and Bob, who live next door, were wonderful hosts who made sure we had our privacy while also assuring our stay had no hiccups. Excellent!\nWe would return again and again and again."", 'What a special place! My son and I so enjoyed our week in this little blue house boat. The kitchen / living room are lovely and just the right size :) and the bedrooms are small but have comfy queen beds and just enough room to get around. Everything was clean and worked well and felt well cared for. But most special is the location - it feels private enough, just set off to the side of an enchanting eclectic house boat community dock, down a steep ramp (at low tide) you have a view of the bay and the marina and Mount Tam off the front dock or the the top deck. We LOVED watching and riding the tide in and out each day, and getting onto the bay in the kayaks was such a treat. Good to note if you are sensitive - the house does make a little noise, creaks and pops and thumps now and then as it settles at low tide or lifts off - but it is easy to get used to it. I hope we will be back soon!', 'A great place on the water in a lovely float home community.', 'What a fabulous and quirky place to stay. Lois was a brilliant host and the location is superb. We were two couples and stayed 5 nights and had no problem with sharing the space. Very pleased we chose to stay in Sausilito instead of San Francisco. Easy to Uber/ferry into the city but a lovely retreat at the end of the day. Great places for breakfast within a walk, especicially the Bayside cafe and Fred’s. And at night thoroughly recommend Fish for a dining experience. Used kayaks and hired electric bikes to see muir woods. Totally Recommend', 'This houseboat is a dream. The location is beautiful and the houseboat is cosy and has absolutely everything you could need. I think this may be my favourite Airbandb stay.

The proximity to Sausalito and Mt. Tam was great. We would definitely stay again.', ""I had Lois's houseboat on my wishlist for years and it gets booked so often it was hard to find and open date - and then I did!

From the moment we stepped onto the dock to walk toward the house, we felt as though we were transported to another time and place. I stayed for four nights with my husband and two boys, ages 8 and 9. We drove up from LA for a family vacation. A few highlights:\nThe community is gorgeous. Every house is different, adorable, and well maintained.\nThe surrounding water is calm and clean.\nThere is a deli and diner (with yummy fresh juices) walkable from the house and there are more restaurants all within an eight minute drive.\nParking is a breeze.\nThe house itself was very well designed.

We will be back, as houseboat living was a wonderful and peaceful new way of vacationing for us. Thank you Louis and Bob!', 'This charming little houseboat is a truly a treasure. The picturesque location is both breathtaking and relaxing at the same time. The floating “neighborhood” had very peaceful and quiet vibe and we were very comfortable during our stay. It was fun to experience the changing tides and watch all the boating activity come and go. The neighbors we encountered on the surrounding docks were friendly and inviting. As for the house itself, we very much appreciated the well-appointed kitchen with updated and high quality amenities, making cooking in during the evenings all the more enjoyable. The nearby restaurants are delicious as well. We enjoyed walking to and from the local market, admiring the extensive houseboat community and beautiful boats in the marinas.\nThe beds were very comfortable and all the linens (bedding and bath) of excellent quality.\nWe loved using the unique, yet fully functional (and leak proof) wooden bathroom shower/tub with “on-demand” hot water.\nLois and Bob are extraordinary hosts, very friendly and accommodating. We really felt we could do our own thing during our stay while at the same time, having peace of mind in knowing they would be helpful and responsive right next door if we needed anything during our stay.\nWe will definitely be looking forward to booking this floating gem again in the future.']",['4 guests · 2 bedrooms · 2 beds · 1 bath']

It is a large bedroom with an attached bathroom with a private gated entrance, and a separate door that does connect to the host's home. It was very clean and cozy, with nice touches (mini fridge with beverages, tea bags, coffee mix). Marjorie was very responsive. When there were wifi issues on the first day, she immediately brought in a wifi extender and helped sort it out. It was a great location and I felt safe.

When we visit SF again, we’d be thrilled to stay here again.', 'Marjorie and her husband are fast to respond to questions and very helpful and accommodating. The space is comfortable and exactly as described. The location is central to lots of districts (Lyfts from the Mission or Civic Center are about $12), though it’s sort of between neighborhoods; it’s a great launching spot, but not a cute street with cafes and bookstores that you’ll want to linger on, like nearby Hayes Valley and Pacific Heights. All in all, a terrific way to visit San Francisco.', ""I had a fantastic stay at Majorie's place - she was kind enough to put in a microwave and there was a fridge there too, which was all I needed. She was very responsive and was quick to reply. I ended up booking this place again :)"", 'Marjorie was so kind and generous. The unit is in a really nice and central location.

Several happy hours spent in the local Oyster Bar, which was great value for money. Very walkable to downtown (though some might be intimidated by some sights - if so then #38 bus on Geary is great, Waymos even better!!). Overall a great stay.

It's quite close to a supermarket as well, which was handy. It was clean and had everything I needed for my four-night stay. The hosts were quick to respond and flexible with check-in which I really appreciated. The only small downside I found was that the walls were quite thin, so I would recommend bringing earplugs if you are a light sleeper - I didn't hear anything the first night but I think it was another guest a couple days in who talked quite loudly on the phone. However it's a great choice for an affordable option in San Francisco, seems well connected with public transport, and is really ideal if you want something close to San Francisco State University."", 'Thank you for creating the comfortable stay, Isaac (and Doug)!

This is a lovely home away from home and highly recommended.', 'I stay in Air BnB’s a lot and this is one of the best. The hosts are amazing and Chad gave us some really good local recommendations. The neighborhood is so close to the BART and very convenient and affordable to get to other places around San Francisco. We rented a car and the freeway was right there and so easy!\nThe space is very cozy and the bed very comfortable. There were so many nice touches and amenities. The bathroom had everything you need and the kitchen had coffee snacks and water. Everything about this one is so well thought out for the guest. Will definitely be back. Thanks Stephanie and Chad!', 'Stephanie and Chad place is a great place if you don’t mind taking the Bart and public transport to SF. It’s a little noisy b/c of the light rail but you will get use to it. I think the light rail stops around midnight. They also provide ear plugs if you need it. The bed was very comfy and they have a big TV for you to enjoy. they are very responsive as well. Thank you again.', ""Stephanie and Chad were amazing hosts. They were very friendly and responsive whenever we had a question. They provide clipper cards that you can load money onto to get around the city.

If you have any questions, we were always able to get in touch with them.\nThe location is fine, with the public you can get anywhere well until you understand the system, it takes a while. We would choose the property again!', 'This was my first Airbnb stay. I had a very pleasant experience. I got exactly what I signed for at a very reasonable price. So everything in the description as well as photos are all accurate and up to date. The hosts had everything I could need. They respond quickly and are easy to communicate to. So grateful for my stay there. This place deserves the high recommendation it was given.', ""Travelled solo to San Francisco for work, and Stephanie's place worked out great for me. Apartment was clean, well equipped, and though attached to the house, felt completely private. The real advantage was the location. BART is a 3-5 minute walk away and a quick ride (~15min) to both downtown and the airport.\nThe one note of caution which others have raised (and is spelled out clearly in the listing) is the MUNI train running right past the house. It's pretty loud and fairly frequent. I wasn't in the apartment all that much for it to be troublesome, and I had no problem sleeping through it with earplugs. Besides, all the complimentary snacks (especially the Nutter Butters) more than made up for it."", 'Perfectly situated next to public transportation. My boyfriend and I had a great stay. Thank you Chad & Stephanie! :)', 'Everything was great.', ""Stéphanie's place is great, perfect when you want to stay for several days! Stéphanie and Chad are very welcoming and available, I recommend it!"", 'This was my second stay with Stephanie and Chad and soooo good that I extended my stay! The kindness that they show, the welcoming into their place made my entire stay feel like home away from home. They communicate so well and anything that I needed they were on top of it.

Anytime I’m in town they will be my first choice!', 'The place was really optimal for our San Francisco visit. You were at a metro station on foot within 5 minutes and a supermarket was also not far away either.\nThe apartment itself is really very nice and reflects the effort of the hosts perfectly. The hosts are very nice, likeable and helpful.\nWe can therefore highly recommend the apartment.', 'Lovely place to stay, has everything you need and right next to the bart station. Steph and Chad were very helpful with any questions we had! Would recommend!', 'Stephanie and Chad’s place was great! It is right next to the Bart which makes everything accessible. Super well equiped, they provide everything you need for your visit. The bidet is a huge plus, we always miss ours when we travel.

Also, the bed was crazy comfortable. Slept like a log!', 'The apartment is well located, meters from the MUNI (this makes it very noisy), and a few blocks away from all means to go anywhere in the city. It is highly equipped and the hosts leave multiple food, drinks, snacks, and bathroom items as an extra, which is very useful and differentiating during the stay. Access via the garage is a bit uncomfortable for luggage access. Chad is a very friendly person and it is a pleasure to chat with him. It was a very good stay.', 'Close and easy access to public transportation. Comfortable bed, amazing towels. Had all the ameneities you need if you didn’t pack much. Hosts quickly respond to messages. I did not get to interact in person with the hosts so place felt very private. But if I did, I imagine them being super friendly and personable. You can tell the hosts want to make sure you are settled comfortably. I would stay here again for my next SF trip!', 'Enjoyed our stay with Chad and Stephanie. They were welcoming and the goodies were a nice gesture!', ""My 10-year-old son and I had a wonderful stay. We took public transportation everywhere and the location really can't be beat. I've stayed in the heart of the city before but this location was actually more convenient to get to multiple parts of the city easily-the Bart provided easy access to downtown and the waterfront while nearby buses got us to the Richmond/Sunset easily. The convenience to the airport and the ability to drop our bags prior to check-in was also so appreciated. The snacks were a warm welcome after our flight. On top of it, the place was just as described, warm, comfortable, clean and the hosts couldn't have been lovelier and more helpful. As others have mentioned, you do hear the muni so if you are sensitive to noise (we aren't) that is something to think about but earplugs are provided. We slept easily and weren't bothered by it at all but earplugs are provided if needed. We would stay here again without question on future trips to San Francisco!!"", 'Hosts were very helpful and kind.

Loved the stay', ""I enjoyed our stay and Steph and Chad's. They were friendly, helpful and generous with the snacks. transport links are really good, easy to get around the city.\nA few things that we noticed:\nNo kettle, no coasters (maybe this is a British thing but it would be fine)\nThe shower mechanism was different to what we're used to so instructions would have helped.\nLimited lighting but not much that can be done about this.\nNoise, as mentioned in previous reviews but it was manageable.\nWe loved all the toiletries, snacks and plenty of towels which helped as we were there for a few days. They let us use the washing machine.\nThanks!"", ""Convenient accommodation and a few minutes from Balboa Park Bart station and therefore in a strategic position to reach both downtown and the airport. A lot of attention from Chad and Steph in supplying it with everything you need and in meeting the guests' needs, including the flexibility to check out.

Good value for the Bay Area! Very thoughtful hosts! Highly recommend!', ""The house was very comfortable to stay in, the beds were very comfy, the shampoo, conditioner etc provided were of good quality and a variety of snacks were provided. The surrounding area is very quiet and safe, a 10 minute walk to a street called ocean ave which has a very good selection of speciality restaurants. If you don't have a car, it's a 5 minute walk to the metro station, all lines of the metro go through this stop, and it's only a few stops to the zoo and the city centre. And it's very safe here, unlike the city centre where there are a lot of homeless people. The landlord Stephanie is very welcoming and responds quickly to questions and he allowed me to check-in a few hours early."", 'Very nice place next to public transportation!\nChad and Stephanie are very friendly and accommodating. They gave us advice and recommendations along our stay and were kind enough to let us store our luggage in their garage during our last day in SF.\nThe airbnb is perfectly independent, you only have to cross the garage to access it and you have everything you need for a few days’ stay.\nThe bed was very comfortable too 😉.\nDefinitely recommend to stay at Stephanie and Chad’s !', 'I’ve stayed here multiple times and it’s a wonderful AirBnB!

It was so easy to get anywhere on public transport and parking was SO EASY!! What a great place. Thank you!!', ""We've stayed at many Airbnb's in our time, and this was by far the best! Mark & Michael have a beautiful home, with a very convenient private side entrance for guests, in an area that is incredibly beautiful.\nThe hosts went above and beyond - by some distance! Without going into too much detail, I needed a place to have some books delivered to, the guys not only provided this is the form of a PO Box shop, but also went to the shop to collect the books themselves!! I'm talking two very heavy boxes!! This essentially made my entire trip to the US sooo much easier, I simply cannot thank them enough.\nThe little amenity touches are really lovely, from beer to coffee to chocolate and more, makes you feel right at home. Plus if you have a bad weather day then the TV is packed with content like Netflix, Apple TV & HBO Max.\nBy far the most responsive hosts we've ever come across, they couldn't do more for us - we can't wait to stay there again!"", 'One of the best stays in a great neighborhood! I got to SF early and was able to drop of my luggage in their garage so that I could head to the office and Mike and Mark had my luggage in my room when I got back in the evening.

Parking near here is a nightmare so good to have the option offered by the hosts of nearby overnight parking. Thanks for a great stay in your beautiful home!', 'Very clean great location very cute very thoughtful with bathroom products and snacks and water. Only\nIssue is despite the private entrance and the mini fridge/ sink, this place is very much a “private room” rather than a “whole place” the door in the room went into the rest of the house where other people were audibly living/staying. It wasn’t on a split floor where the owners or other guests felt far from us. We could hear people right outside the door which was fine but definitely not something I’ve experienced in “whole place” listing with a “whole place” price range. It was just a bit off. Otherwise totally nice beautiful private room with a private entrance and lovely sink and bathroom and mini fridge. But felt very close to other guests or owners we could hear through the door in the room that went to the rest of the house. Not a bad stay just maybe not the most accurately described. Less privacy than we had anticipated.', 'Amazing hosts!\nAmazing place!\nGreat communication!\nPerfect for a weekend getaway!', 'Absolutely love this Airbnb and cannot wait to return.\nLocation: 10/10.

Even provided a blanket and cooler to enjoy sunset at the park (highly recommend).. Overall a perfect stay and a perfect host.. Thank you again.. 😊', 'We had such a wonderful stay at this Airbnb in San Francisco! The hosts were extremely attentive and responsive whenever we reached out, and were accommodating when we needed to leave our luggage somewhere until our flight in the evening. They have paid close attention to cleanliness and offer great amenities! We really enjoyed the espresso machine. The bathroom was also super clean, which was appreciated! It’s a great neighborhood, with Dolores Park nearby (great playground for the kids), and tons of restaurants/bars within walking distance, as well as easy access to public transportation. The hosts offer excellent recommendations in the neighborhood and are longtime SF residents, so they know what they’re talking about! It is a very small space, so keep that in mind. We are a family of 4, so it was tight at times, but we knew this was the case. Just keep it in mind if you are booking and think you might need more space.', 'We had a great stay at Michael’s place and I can only wish we had a few more days in SF. We travelled with our 10 years old son and the place was perfect for the 3 of us. Michael was extremely helpful with very prompt communication and guidance for the best things in the neighbourhood. Would definitely recommend a stroll in Dolores park and the almond croissant at Le Marais. We also found a great knitting shop just outside the studio and this was an added bonus. Having the access to delicious coffee in the studio meant we could start the day refreshed and full of energy to explore. All in all, a great stay and would thoroughly recommend the place. Thank you so much Michael and Mark xx', 'We loved it and would surely return!\nIt is a small but really charming place and the interior is well thought and beautiful. It is close to the park and the tramway station and some nice cafés/restaurants. We loved it to stay there.', 'This place is a gem!! They keep it immaculate. It has everything you want. Fastest response time of any AirBnB I have ever stayed in. Landlords are always available yet invisible and never intrusive. You’d never know they live upstairs. I love the separate entrance only for you. Very thoughtful touches of snacks and drinks. They could not do enough to make me feel\nwelcome in their home. Walking distance to all the bars and many great restaurants. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!!', 'Great place & convenient!!', 'Our Air B&B was cozy, clean, and stocked with all the essentials we could need for our stay in the great city of San Fran! Not only did we have a meticulously curated binder with all the hot spots (within walking distance!) hand-picked for our convenience, we started our morning with fresh espresso and chai tea from the mini bar while wrapped in fuzzy robes. Michael was kind enough to respond when we needed to restock on items, but otherwise we had everything at our fingertips. The accessibility was everything at the end of the day—you could not be closer to the best cafes, lunch spots, and even Lyft access was phenomenal. 10/10 would recommend!!', 'Michael and Mark have a beautiful home and it was lovely getting to stay in a part of it!

Would love to stay again!', 'This place is perfect! The location is terrific, the space is spotless, and there are so many thoughtful extras--bathrobes, picnic baskets, recommendations of great places to eat, little treats, twinkly lights . . . . But the best part is the responsiveness of the kind hosts. From the first, Michael helped me decide if I was going to rent a car or walk; when I was there he helped me out of a self-induced jam; he was patient and on point when I needed to communicate. Highly recommend.', 'Absolutely loved this place! Michael and Mark were the MOST welcoming of hosts and had thought through every little detail - from water, to bedside chocolates, to extra blankets.

Would highly highly recommend this listing to anyone traveling to SF area if you can snag it!!', 'The luxury studio lives up to its name: Michael truly thought of everything to make my stay comfortable - things like automatic lighting when coming up the staircase at night, perfect instructions on how to get in, great lighting options in the studio, nice products in the bathroom, nespresso coffee, snacks in the kitchenette, even a chocolate on the bed stand! I highly recommend for a San Fran stay (except don’t stay here, so that’s it’s available next time I’m in town! ;)', ""What a perfect place for a night or two away in the city. It's private, cozy, easy to find and walkable to so many great places both around the Mission and beyond. I really appreciated that I had my own entrance and that there was no shared space whatsoever. It's like your own little private oasis to come back to when you need a break from exploring and just want to rest. The shower was clean and wonderful, the bed was big and cozy, and there was even water and snacks for any emergency needs you might have. Will 100% book here again for future city adventures."", ""Michael's listing is as advertised: a small but effective studio that is very close to Dolores Park and all its restaurants, yet removed enough so that you can have a restful sleep.\nWe spend a long weekend at this studio. Me and my wife on the main bed, and my 5 year old in the couch. We enjoyed the Nespresso machine, the spotless bathroom, and the recommendation to try the French brunch spot just around the corner.\nThe only downside to this place is the price. Considering this is San Francisco though, it is understandable.\n*We would definitely stay again on Michael's studio.*"", ""There is literally nothing they didn't think of for their guests....right down to plush bath robes and even a lint roller. I might suggest a white noise maker to block out some of the street noise, but other than that I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this property.

One, prepare for noise from upstairs, who I think are the owners. The noise is CONSTANT! Its there first thing in the morning, all through the day, and late at night. To the owners credit, they do provide earplugs (who wants to wear that all day). If you are a light sleeper this is not for you. The lightwell door by the bathroom has a constant draft which makes showers a little chilly. Also, at the time, the shower in the bathroom didn't have a door, so water goes EVERYWHERE and makes a mess.

The apartment is really nice and included a spacious kitchen. There is not an oven, but there is a stove top, which is really all we needed so it worked well for us. You can hear people walking upstairs, and it's occasionally loud, but it was not bothersome to either of us. It's two blocks from the beach, which is really fun. During the day there are a lot of people there with their dogs, and it's a really fun place to hang out. If you haven't been to San Fransisco before, I would be aware there are a lot of homeless people out at night, and our car got broken into when we were in Tenderloin seeing a movie. This did NOT happen anywhere near the airbnb, which is in a safe neighborhood free of homeless people.

He is filled with helpful tips and suggestions for local spots, getting around, etc., and always responded to my texts quickly. The location is just a couple blocks from the beach and away from the noise of downtown, although downtown is still easy to reach in roughly 30 minutes via bus/train. I had no problem finding street parking on my Fri-Mon stay. The unit is as pictured with all the listed amenities. Occasionally you can hear minor noise or pets upstairs as you would in any house, but this was by no means a negative and I was able to sleep perfectly fine each night.

I’d recommend this airbnb to anyone.', ""This is a basement apartment where the host's family lives upstairs. The entrance is separate and secure. Parking on the street can be difficult during busy times but we were always able to find a spot relatively close. The sunset district is lovely to walk around at all parts of the day to look at the distinctive houses and plant life. The apartment was simple but clean- a place to sleep and cook, not so much to hang out at. The host's dogs upstairs did bark with our comings and goings, but we are dog people and didn't mind hearing of their presence. Overall great experience for the price."", 'Loved staying here!

Public bus stop was right by the beach giving easy access to all of San Francisco without needing a car. This downstairs apartment was nice with a comfortable bed, some closet space for clothes, reasonably spacious kitchen (although table area is tight), full refrigerator, and 4 burner stove. And although there was no oven there was a decent size toaster oven. Note that there is a short step up going from kitchen to hallway & bedroom that one has to get used to. There was limited (but sufficient) space for letting dishes dry, and the space was setup for recycling/composting all non-trash items. Basic groceries and coffee were all a short walk away, with a full grocery store a longer walk (or short bus ride) away. The apartment was a little warm for us and we did not find a thermostat to adjust the temp down, but opening a window did the trick and allowed us to better hear the ocean waves.

But once you’re inside the building, the lock on the actual condo door was difficult to secure and therefore as a woman traveling solo, I didn’t feel as safe as I would’ve wanted to.

He also helped clarify that laundry was available at the rental and that I was welcome to use it freely. Although I received conflicting information about the laundry during checkin, he cleared that up right away.\nI think there must have been an issue with the cleaners before we arrived, due to the low soap and what I think was a leftover towel hanging up in the bathroom.

The location of the bath in the main bedroom doesn't work well with 4 adults. Having a glass door between the living spaces wasn't great either, when lights were on in one area and people in the other wanted to sleep. Getting the heat going was tricky, it would have been nice if it was warmed up before we got there.\nI would recommend this for a short stay. Though it has a stove, refrigerator and lots of kitchen supplies, it doesn't have a disposal or dishwasher. With only 4 of each cup, plate, mug and bowl, it required a lot of dishwashing for anyone trying to eat meals there. Or just buy some paper plates!!\nThe spot lighting is really bright, a dimmer would have been appreciated as well as a lamp that you could see by in the living room."", 'Peter was a great host with quick responses and clear communication.

I booked a car for the last couple days of my stay and didn't have too much of an issue finding parking. I highly recommend and plan on returning should I ever be in SanFran. Also, check out the recommendations - Hot Sauce & Panko (10/10), Tint Nail Spa, Gum Zu Yin Foot Reflexology, and Arsicault Bakery Civic Center(10/10 - a must!) were excellent!

Blanket, games, coffee….For us, It was basically a place to lay our heads down at night. We didn’t spend any time there during the day. My only slight gripes…once you opened the entry door, you have to walk through their garage to get to another door which led you to the unit. It was hard to see cause it was dark so we had to use our phones to see cause we couldn’t find the light switch. The other slight issue was, there is no sound barrier between you and the people above you that are in the main house.

There is also an awesome coffee shop on the same block just around the corner. The breakfast sandwich is to die for. ￼Of note, the stairs to the living space are steep and a little narrow. I am 62 and in good shape, and it was no problem at all, but it could be if there are some physical limitations.Even with that said, I’m sure Jane would work it out one way or another.Also one has to get used to some low ceilings on the edges of the living space.But easily manageable', 'If we could live in Jane’s attic, we would!

We walked a few places in Bernal Heights (the hilltop park is a must with beautiful views) and to Mission St during the day, but other than that we took ubers around. We had a late flight, so we arrived late and parking was a challenge, but we eventually found a spot a block away. There was a small deck with a nice view which we enjoyed. Overall, the place was very nice, location was decent, and I would recommend it.', ""It's a good place, and convenient to get around into the city. I had a car and parking wasn't much of an issue. Getting through that part of the area involves maneuvering through tight and steep streets, which I'm not used to being from NY. Also the stairs leading to the door is super steep and you need to be extremely careful when going up or down with your bags or if you're buzzed. Lol The great thing is I was able to drive into the missions area in ten mins. I'd recommend this to my friends."", 'Michael is a great host and his place is perfect for a short stay in the city. I enjoyed every moment in the apartment and will be back next time I visit SF.', 'Super cute and cozy place!', ""The house is beautiful. It's very homey and comfortable, and the directions were clear and welcoming. The most frustrating thing for me was that I had expected parking to be easier than it was. The description listed it as being in a neighborhood with easy parking. I was barely able to find a spot which was quite a ways away from where I was staying, and the streets are so small and narrow that if I had parked by the house to unload I would've completely blocked traffic so I ended up walking from the one parking spot I did find up and down a very hilly area with all of my luggage. Don't wear heels! I also would've loved to know where to put my garbage. I had a hard time figuring out the heater but the bed was comfortable and the place itself is quite lovely. The view is beautiful and about a $10 Uber trip from the Moscone center."", 'Great spot for a business trip to San Francisco. Private and streamlined!', 'All as promised!', 'Very cozy apartment with a nice view outside. Quiet and walking distance from Precita park. Check in and out was easy.', ""This was our second mini-break in Bernal Heights--a peaceful, walkable, charming neighborhood in San Francisco that is safe and has street parking. This studio was perfect for us. Due to the weather forecast, we only went out one night, deciding to hang on to our parking space and Lyft it to dinner. We brought supplies in case we wanted to cook and did. The full kitchen is small for two but reasonably well-supplied. We had to get olive oil and vinegar from the local market, but we live in the East Bay, so we'll use it! Kitchen knives are sharp, which was terrific and not typical for Airbnbs. The bed is super comfortable. The table by the window was nice for meals with a spectacular view of the city. We heard the family upstairs in the afternoon quite a bit. The host is clear on this point and supplies earplugs!\nWe had decided to Netflix and chill a bit and found the couch somewhat uncomfortable for this. The bathtub was great with plenty of hot water! W/D is accessible 24/7"", 'Clean, comfortable, and nice view of the city. Very quiet and had everything we needed.', 'This place was awesome! A great view, good parking, and a lot of amenities within walking distance, especially a nice cafe that was good for breakfast. Very quiet.', ""Everything was smooth sailing after the initial state of panic. Checked in later in the evening and totally missed the small path to the lower unit door. Went up the stairs and struggled with the lockbox before messaging Michael. He was so quick to respond, and informed me I was at the wrong door :/ oops!\nThis is the cleanest AirBnb I've stayed at. Great, quiet location. Parking was easy. Heater kept me warm. Will definitely book when I'm back in my old city!"", 'I had a great stay here. The studio is fairly large with a nice comfy bed. It was just what I needed for 3 days of work, relax, repeat.\nIts fairly close to the 101, so the SOMA was a 10-15 minutes with Uber.\nThanks!', 'Great place, very comfortable and quiet.

We would absolutely stay here again!', 'Michaels place was super clean! We had everything we needed in this space! We had a great time celebrating our 30 year anniversary in San Francisco and I am glad we chose to stay at Michaels and experience the true culture of the area. Everything was great - if I had to make someone aware of anything...it would probably be that the steps to walk up to the door are pretty steep - but we are 51 and 53 years old and had no problem. We always had a parking place - maybe not right in front of the house but there was parking - the street is narrow and curvy just like all the other streets in San Francisco! :) It always felt safe and the view was beautiful! Michael is always quick to respond if we had any questions.', 'Michael is not just a Superhost – he`s truly an exceptional one. From the moment I booked, he was attentive, and responsive, and made sure every detail was taken care of. The studio itself was a gem—spacious, peaceful, and tucked away from street noise, offering a sense of safety and calm. It’s stocked with everything you could need, from a fully equipped kitchen to laundry facilities, and the bed was incredibly comfortable.\nEven though I didn’t have a car, getting around was easy thanks to the accessible public transport options, making it simple to reach the heart of San Francisco.\nWhat really made the stay special was Michael’s warmth and professionalism. He genuinely cares about his guests and goes above and beyond to make sure you feel at home. It was one of the best stays I’ve had, and I wouldn’t hesitate to say that it’s a blessing to find his home available and book it. Thank you, Michael!', 'Lovely place, clean and a quiet scenic neighborhood. Prepare to workout your legs!', ""I felt right at home at Michael's apartment. It's a cozy, functional and thoughtfully put together space. I really appreciated the extras that were provided that you don't often find - washer and dryer with detergent provided, toilet paper and paper towel to get started, dish soap, coffee pods, etc. Parking was always very easy right in front of the unit with no restrictions, or around the corner. If you don't have a car then be prepared for exercise going up and down the hill. Precita Park and some local shops are easily walkable, south Mission or Bernal Heights are more of a hike. I usually drove though. Some small features I liked: the tap-on bedside lights and the curtain which can divide the bedroom from the living space. Everything was very relaxed, peaceful, quiet and easy. I extended my stay and would return again."", 'Cute place with all they key basics. Parking is no problem.

It has a very well equipped kitchen, nice bathroom, washing facilities, fast internet, and feels spacious throughout. The location in Bernal Heights is safe, quiet and private, and there are several great bars, cafes and grocery shops within walking distance.

Large, spacious and modern apartment with a washer and dryer. (These are common amenities in other cities but they're rare and expensive in SF). It was an easy 10-15 minute lyft ride to/from my office in soma (this apartment is near the freeway, so it makes for a quick commute).\nWhile the apartment exceeded my expectations for a business trip (and as someone who has been to SF more times than I can count), I'm not sure I would recommend it to someone who is visiting SF as a tourist (it's a bit too secluded, which I loved, but I know there are more lively neighborhoods to stay in that I would recommend to a friend visiting SF for a vacation)."", 'A great stay!', 'Great spot!

Lainie is an excellent communicator and we wanted for nothing, but I'm sure if we had, she would have been on it! Very clean throughout. Great night lights allowed for an easy nighttime trip to the restroom. It was quiet too - no outside noises or noises from upstairs, which made for a peaceful night's sleep.

Overall, we were very pleased and hope this place is available for future stays. It was a perfect location for us!"", ""Absolutely wonderful stay. Fantastic location. You're a 1 block walk from tons of great food. The owners are beyond lovely. The only(literally) real drawback I can think of is the street parking gets a bit tight in the evening. But, the owners held spots in front of the house for us and just moved their car to their garage when we arrived. It was awesome. The place itself is cozy, cute and clean. They thought of everything you could need and clealry(and cutely) label everything. Fans, space heaters, coffee, decaf, tea, complimentary juice and beer, a bowl of various snacks. Friendly, safe neighborhood. They know their neighbors well and the neighbors at one point saw us in the dark trying to figure out which door we needed to use and helped us out. Just nice people everywhere. Adorable back yard. I can't even think of any minor constructive criticism. Great wifi, a binder full of\nbrochures, extra pillows, blankets, a book shelf full of books.

A nice quiet neighborhood away from downtown, yet only a block to the bus, 7/11, restaurants and little shops to buy fruit or snacks. And it\'s just a straight walk ""downhill"" approx a mile to the ocean & beach.\nWe used über to get back & forth from oracle park for the Stadium Concert we attended and fisherman\'s wharf for day trips/exploring on the other days, which I didn\'t think was overly costly if not too late at night.\nIt was also an easy transfer from the bus (a block away) straight to the underground train which took us 1 block away from the Market Pier to shop, eat or take the cable car to Pier 39.\nOne of the best parts of our stay (for me) was relaxing after a full day of site-seeing in either the comfy bed or in the backyard/garden with beautiful flowers all around me, succulents and pear & lemon trees with a delicious coffee to enjoy the end of my day! And in the mornings I even enjoyed Charlie\'s hummingbirds flying around!\nThere\'s a lot to do & see...my son & I enjoyed many of the ""must see"" places and were very pleased with all the tips, hints, menus and maps available at our fingertips in our suite.\nI\'m glad we chose to stay at Lainie & Charlie\'s, was the best for us and we have no regrets, just praise!

They were flexible with check-in time, and Charlie greeted us and showed us around when we we arrived. He was very friendly, as was Lainie when we ran into her while waiting on an Uber.

Lainie helped us with street parking, which worked out well. I highly recommend this apartment.', 'Lainie was an excellent host and very responsive. The unit was just as described and fairly easy to enter — the neighborhood can be a little removed from the rest of the city but it makes up for it in being extremely quiet and peaceful. The hosts do insist on personally checking everyone in which was a minor conflict as I had a late arrival due to an Amtrak train.

Lands End is 2.4 miles (walkable if you want), Presideo, Chrissy Field, Fort Point, etc.\nClement Street is a few blocks away with a good variety of restaurants and a Sunday Farmers Market.\nThe kitchen is well stocked with full sized refrigerator, Viking stove top and convection/microwave.

Space and location were great, definitely recommend!', 'We had a nice stay at Toni’s apt. It’s very well designed small 1 bed, 1 bath in the lower level of their townhouse. Beautiful garden is right outside kitchen door. At first thought access via garage seemed odd but it’s actually quite easy with code pad and no stairs makes it easy in and out. The kitchen is setup perfect with plenty of condiments if your looking to cook no need to buy basics, all the spices and what not are there for use. Surprised how quiet the area is. The park is walking distance as are some great restaurants. We ubered around but bus lines are near. What a great find for an Airbnb stay!', 'This is a very nice, well-equipped apartment. Excellent location and friendly host. A top choice.', ""It's perfect. Beautiful light streaming in at all hours, comfortable bed, lovely lush back yard. Tranquil. Great art pieces inside and out. Toni is a warm and thoughtful host, and this is the best location you could find in the city. Golden Gate Park, with its museums and gardens and tennis courts, is two blocks away. I wish I could keep this place all to myself, but to anyone reading this and looking for a place in San Francisco...stay here, and prepare to be enchanted!"", 'Great location and very comfortable bed!', ""We absolutely loved Toni's place. It was cozy, but spacious enough for two people. It's beautifully decorated, and the backyard garden is very serene. Everything we needed was in the kitchen, including a whole spice rack.\nIf you're on foot (or bike) this is a perfect place to stay, wedged between the Presidio and Golden Gate Park. The grocery store was close, as were a few restaurants. I had a knee injury and it was still easy to get to around by foot and on the buses. The bus going from downtown to Ocean Beach is right around the corner, and the others are a few blocks away.\nYou can hear folk walking above, but it isn't disturbing - just what you'd expect from a typical basement apartment. The bed was very comfortable, luxurious I'd say, and the sofa was a comfortable place to sit and read or watch TV. And the host, Toni, is just wonderful."", 'We had a wonderful stay! Toni was very gracious and the location was so close to great things to do. You can walk to Golden Gate Park in 10 minutes or less and you can do something different there every day. Also, there are limitless food options nearby, which include some yummy bakeries! The Presidio is also very close and you can have some wonderful experiences there as well. We would highly recommend staying at this AirBNB.', 'Comfy and cozy furniture in this cute rental. The bed was heavenly after long days of walking in the park. The kitchen was bright and well stocked. Gorgeous backyard space (Toni was quite a green thumb). Toni was friendly and welcoming, even brought us strawberries from the farmers market. We had a pleasant stay and would definitely rent here again. Lots of restaurants in walking distance (Taste Buds has a great breakfast). Enjoy!', 'great place right next to the park, coffee etc. Toni is responsive and helpful. beautiful garden too..', 'Convenient, cozy, and safe place to stay in SF close to restaurants and public transit. Toni and husband were great hosts.', 'I came to SF with my husband and 6 month old baby and we had an absolutely great time at Toni’s place! Everything about it was 10/10 and Toni and her husband were incredibly kind and welcoming. She had a pack and play for the baby that was great as well. She also kindly left some coffee for us. The kitchen is fully stocked for those who like to cook, though there are plenty of amazing food options nearby. I would definitely come back to Toni’s place on a future visit!', ""I stayed at Toni's place for a few days with my younger brother. It was beautiful, quiet and peaceful. I enjoyed the backyard garden with all the beautiful flowers. Toni had a binder full of great recommendations to do around town. I found the location very convenient for most of things I wanted to do in San Francisco. Toni was friendly and warm. I'd ve more than happy to return for a future visit!"", ""We really enjoyed staying here. Highly recommend. One of the more stylish, well-designed one bedrooms we've stayed at. Super-chill neighborhood with great spots in walking distance. And, most notably, the hosts were very welcoming and super helpful. We'd definitely like to come back."", 'Comfortable and convenient. Easy to walk to groceries and museums, and easy to get Uber. Comfortable enough and with a good enough kitchen for a long stay. An attractive real San Francisco neighborhood, with little restaurants and shops. Not perfect for someone who only cares about being downtown, but perfect for someone who wants to visit the whole city, Marin and the South Bay.', 'Toni was so great & so sweet to my daughter & helped her make a little fort under the stairs. Location is great.\nMake sure to go to Burma Superstar down the street for AMAZING food. Cinderella bakery was great for Russian pastries and our favorite coffee was Rise and Grind. All within a 10 min walk!\nThank you Toni!', 'Our stay at Toni’s was fantastic. Her and her husband were extremely kind and responsive. We were traveling with a baby and arriving late, and they went the extra step to have the play pen (which they provided) all set up for when we got there so we didn’t have to do that late at night! The kitchen was wonderful, which we used every day to make some delicious meals. The backyard was stunning and private - we used the BBQ several times and Toni even let us pick some Meyer lemons that grow in their yard! The bed was extremely comfortable and having the bedroom separate from the rest of the living spaces made putting the baby to sleep before us a breeze (the room was virtually blackout which is also amazing for a baby). The space can get quite warm but as soon as we mentioned that they were able to turn down the heat and it was extremely comfortable for the duration of our stay. Great area, largely walkable and close to several bus routes. Thanks so much, we will definitely be back!!', 'Toni was so sweet and accommodating! We had a blast and such an easy time exploring San Francisco. We’d be ecstatic to stay at Toni’s again', 'We had a delightful stay at Toni’s place. From easy check-in to easy check-out, everything went seamlessly. It was a great location, within walking distance of Golden Gate Park (so many attractions, and lovely walking paths), and restaurants. Her book was full of helpful information and great recommendations. She greeted us personally. I recommend this place highly for a non- downtown San Francisco visit. If you like walking, being outdoors, and peace and quiet, this is the place for you.', 'We had a great time at Toni’s place. The communication was super easy and the place looks exactly like it does on the pictures. The neighborhood is super conveniently located, the apartment is very cozy and quiet. Would absolutely recommend to stay there! We loved our time in SF.', ""We will be back!!! Great place in a nice area. Very clean and well appointed. Toni couldn't have been kinder and more attentive to anything we needed - which was really nothing - they have thought of everything to accommodate for a wonderful stay. Perfect host! Thank you."", 'Lovely place to stay. Highly recommend.', ""To be honest, I didn't spend much time here. I was in SF for a work conference but Toni's apartment is clean, comfortable, and within walking distance to many great eats and the park."", 'A perfect stay while we were moving.

The airbnb had dishes, condiments and tea available for us. TV with all streaming platforms, bathroom products etc. It was so perfect with the sweetest little garden and neighborhood cats !! Can’t wait to hopefully come back with my partner :)', 'What a great week we had! Such a cute apartment with a beautiful garden view each morning. Toni really thought of everything. The restaurants surrounding us were great and our favorite days were spent in the nearby park. When we needed a night of downtime, the kitchen was ready to cook in and laundry could be done. Toni was friendly, informative and full of great recommendations and we just adored her. This ranks one of our top stays.', 'Toni was a great host, and the space was comfortable, clean, and quiet. Great location with tons to do in walking distance. Would absolutely recommend!', 'Toni’s place was charming, restful, beautiful, and put together so thoughtfully. We loved being able to walk to Golden Gate Park, the Botanical Gardens and museums and so many delicious restaurants nearby.\nAs a hostess, Toni was kind, incredibly helpful and communicative.\nIt’s obvious she and her husband have put much thought and care into creating a warm, restful space and we would joyfully book again with them in the future!\nOne small thing that was difficult to tell from the photos and may be helpful for future guests is the dimension of the closet – it has plenty of room for clothes and hanging items, but is not deep enough to place a crib or pack and play in (we were traveling with our baby and Tony very thoughtfully, set up her own pack and play – which was incredibly helpful to have in the space!)', ""This place was a gem! It was in a great neighborhood and had a beautiful secluded back yard where I could sit in the morning and enjoy my coffee amongst the beautiful gardens. This apartment was in a peaceful neighborhood yet close to everything we wanted to do!\nWe were able to walk to Golden Gate Park and we were close to many restaurants. We were also only about 20 minutes to the Pier 39 and Muir Beach.\nToni was so kind and flexible and did her best to make our stay enjoyable.

Felt like we were staying with a family friend in SF!\nThe area was very quiet and private, it also has some amazing food in SF!\nI would highly recommend staying at their place whilst you’re in SF.\nMy partner and I were working from the Airbnb and it honestly had everything we needed!', 'Overall, a good place to stay. Location was great. Felt very safe. Very close to Golden Gate Bridge and the Golden Gate Bridge park. Short drive to oracle park to see the giants. Slightly smaller than I expected but that also could have been on me. Space was very clean, bed was comfortable and the sliding door to the bedroom made it feel more private which was a plus. Major downside was parking was difficult which Toni mentions in her listing so it’s obviously not her fault but the parking spaces are very small on the street and it’s difficult to make sure not blocking a driveway. We needed a car to see the things we wanted to see so was unavoidable for us. Yard was nice but felt a little awkward being in it as there’s a big floor to ceiling window in the hosts kitchen. It’s not a secret that they live above though so again not a major negative just something to be aware of when considering. Good value for money would consider staying again if in the area', 'Toni was such a welcoming and attentive host. The home was cozy, clean, private and the backyard was a serene place to read a book and have a coffee or tea. The beautiful Golden Gate Park is only a few blocks away. So are some great restaurants, cafe and bars. The neighborhood is peaceful and a great hub for destinations both in the city and over the bridge. Next time we are needing a place in San Fran this will be the first place we look to book!', ""Loved, loved staying at Toni and Phillip's place. It's in a great section of San Francisco, very clean, easy street parking, lots of cool local restaurants, coffee, shops, markets near by. It's located between the Presidio and Golden Gate Park so it was easy to walk over to those areas and start hiking! Apartment had a beautiful peaceful garden and all the furnishings were clean, uncluttered, modern, everything to make your stay comfortable. Bed was super comfy. This stay was supposed to just be for my husband and myself, but unfortunately my son who lives in SF got Covid therefore my daughter who was planning to stay with him couldn't do that. Toni very graciously came to our rescue and and allowed my daughter to sleep on the large couch with linens and blankets. This was above and beyond and I'm grateful for her understanding. Toni and Phillip are gracious hosts, you wont regret booking with this unit, and you'll be in a really safe, beautiful area of San Francisco."", ""We had a wonderful stay here. The location is perfect for getting around and within walking distance to so many wonderful bakeries, restaurants, coffee shops, markets, and shops. It's close to Golden Gate Park which offers so much to do. We were able to take the bus downtown to the Pier 39 and we easily rented a car for a day (within walking distance to pickup and return) which was wonderful. The apartment was charming and perfect for 2 people. It was a great place to relax after spending a day out and about. The hosts were absolutely delightful, kind, and friendly. We arrived early in the day our first day and we were able to drop off our luggage until checkin and then we were able to leave our luggage after checkout until we headed to the airport.

This place is a room at the bottom floor of a house, and even though it had a private entrance, it felt less private since other units are right next to yours, and you share a hallway. You can hear others talking in the hallway, but once in their room I didn’t hear them, (unless the others were just really quiet). We tried to be mindful during our stay for this reason. The sink didn’t drain the entirety of our stay, but it wasn’t a huge deal.

I even made a point to contact the host to make sure that it would be a full single-family home and not a duplex, as we wanted to ensure full privacy and not have to worry about issues such as being too loud. Unfortunately, this is not an entire home. The listing is for a converted garage. I was not pleased with this, as I feel that there were much cheaper options in the area for a duplex-like airbnb\'s.

The bed, bathroom and kitchenette were super clean. The backyard garden is a luxury. Very peaceful. Having a full size laundry was great. We were able to do a load of laundry before leaving so everything was clean for the next leg of our trip.\nThe real joy of Hank’s place are the very thoughtful and well-curated booklets, full of suggestions on what to do in San Francisco. The handwritten one is the best! Lastly, I’ll say the notes left around the place make usage easy.\nI did not see an iron or ironing board, but there was a steamer. There was laundry detergent, but no dryer sheets or fabric softener. We didn’t find any wash cloths, however, there are more than enough towels and hand towels.\nAll in all… 5 out of 5, I highly recommend', 'Hank’s place was exactly what we needed.

The house is located on a quiet street and the room has full access to the back patio. It’s a 2-3 min walk to the nearest bus stop, which was great for me because Uber wasn’t economical for the length of my stay. If, like me, you’re visiting the city for the first time, you may be alarmed at first by some of the steep street inclines while walking around the neighborhood. But I learned quickly that it’s no different from what you find in other parts of the city.\nAs a host, Hank was amazing. Clear and concise instructions are laid out around the room and amenities.

The seating in the beautiful garden made me really wish it wasn't raining so I could sit out there. It's close to great hiking trails and some good local restaurants. The sheets are soft and the bed is really comfy. Also, there are no steps to get into the place - it's a ground level entry.

I would stay here again in a heartbeat."", 'Hank was very responsive and went the extra mile to allow us to store our luggage in the garage (before checking in) since we arrived in an AM flight & went sightseeing immediately upon arriving.

We truly enjoyed reading through them all and trying some of them out. Our stay was relaxing and we felt at home. Would gladly return."", 'We had a great stay!

For instance, there was a ton of storage in the bathroom, shelves to put toiletries on, nightstands with drawers and USB power, a laundry basket, and hooks to put things on!! It seems silly to note but we’ve stayed at so many places that don’t have these thoughtful details. It’s located in a peaceful family community, near the beautiful parks and ocean, but there are buses to take you wherever you need to go. We only used our rental car when we left the city.

I recommend it!', ""The best part was waking up to hear the ocean waves from the beach nearby. The suite is a comfortable pit stop for your visit to San Francisco. Almost at the top of the hill it's easy to walk to Sutro Baths. The room got unexpectedly chilly at night but the under floor heating took care of it once we turned it on. The garden is very pretty but it was foggy and chilly in September so we were bundled up. There are a few bus lines close by, but it's better if you have a car to move around. We discovered an amazing Chinese takeout restaurant a couple of blocks away that had the best chicken won ton soup and we missed having a kitchen so we could heat up the leftovers. Hank's book of suggestions led us to a charming thin crust pizza restaurant which was as good as what you would find in Italy.

Somehow it’s much better than the pictures and I now understand all the rave reviews. The private garden right off the unit is filled with roses, lavender and a lemon tree. Natural light floods the entire, spotless apartment— But it’s SF so it doesn’t get hot. Bed is fantastic, as are the sheets. I used the tub and shower and both were fantastic-hot water and good pressure. The garage in SF was the selling point for me- it was reassuring to be able to leave the car somewhere safe. Finally, the location is wonderful, right next to the sutro baths and land’s end trail. My fat ass wishes there was a coffee shop and restaurants a little closer but you can get to one in a little over five minutes.

We were comfortable and happy there! The only thing to note for out of town guests is that there isn't a lot of shops & restaurants within walking distance, so be prepared to utilize public transport or wear some good walking shoes! You'll need those anyway to walk to the beach or Land's End trail nearby ;)"", 'Great home! I loved the decor and aesthetics. Very easy to find and park!
