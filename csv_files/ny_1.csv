The house cat is lovely and didn\'t come into our room which was of course nice as we are not used to having a cat. The flat has a stunning view from the bedroom and kitchen area and of course the great balcony.

Spectacular. We could relax and rest in style and comfort throughout our stay. Vlad was the most perfect host, making us feel so welcome and helped us with plenty of local advice on places to see, visit and eat. It was also very quiet; considering you're in a big building shared with many neighbours, we never heard a thing. The door staff and reception were so friendly, extremely smart and, always happy.\nVlad's place is the perfect location, right opposite the Empire State Building and so central to reach most of the top places to see on foot.\nNearby, we hired a bicycle for 3 hours and completed the Central Park loop, with a picnic to end a perfect day. Central Park was beautiful to see and great fun to cycle around.\nWe used the local transport to and from JFK and it was so simple to access and reliable too."", 'This is your best choice when traveling in New York.

The location is very central which is both a blessing and a curse. It is great that so much is on your doorstep but the curse is that it is all to easy to walk, and walk, and walk.

I would not particularly recommend New York for those deep past retirement but for a younger generation it would be superb. Would I recommend staying with Kyle - definitely yes.', 'Absolutely stunning place, just off Empire State on the 40th floor! Great city skyline 24 hours a day!

This AirBnB will make your NY trip special!', ""We were two adult friends staying at Vlad's for the weekend. For our purposes, the location would be hard to beat. It is close to Penn Station and a direct and easy walk from there, as are trains at 7th Avenue for getting up town for sightseeing and parks. We spent our evenings in Greenwich Village and walked there, too and always felt safe.\nThe cat was curious about us but never a bother.\nThe staff at the door and reception desk were warm, welcoming, friendly and helpful.\nThe room and private bath were more than adequate for the two of us.

Maybe this place is in Jersey, but the view from the balcony and the room is stunning. You get a COMPLETE view of the Manhattan sky line and a private balcony where you can sit and enjoy it.

The view is surreal‚Ä¶ believe me. The room is humongous with 10-11‚Äô ceilings and sparkling clean. I never had the chance to meet the hosts, but I texted them if I had any questions and they answered immediately and graciously. you have a shared entrance to you‚Äôre room, but your room, bath and balcony are completely private.

Well worth it, just be sure on the way back to yell out ‚Äú first stop‚Äù or ‚Äúnext stop ‚Äú as you approach where you want to get off, or better yet, just let them know you wanna get off at Pleasant Ave when you board in nyc. There aren‚Äôt any regular stops‚Ä¶. You need to let them know. We learned the hard way. Lol. And we ate in Weehawkin every night! Lots of places within walking distance where the locals eat and we felt very safe. We did the on-site parking and it was awesome.

This was my first time visiting the NYC area, so I appreciated that very much. We did run into a little problem during our stay. But Sylvia responded within a minute and took care of it very quickly. She is a very responsive host. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. I would stay here again myself.', 'My husband and I were hesitant to stay on the New Jersey side as we were planning on visiting Manhattan for all four days of our stay. We were pleasantly surprised about how easy it was to travel to Sylvia\'s place (we took transit from JFK). Keep in mind every time you travel into Port Authority Terminal (to get to Manhattan) it is a $4US bus ride on top of cost of subway in New York. Despite that additional cost it was a scenic ride into the city as you get a beautiful view of New York\'s Cityscape especially at night! Sylvia was extremely responsive to any messaging and that gave us confidence in being in our ""home away from home"". The space is small but well equipped. Very functional !

I asked for a water bottle and they brought me plenty, which was very useful when traveling. There were plenty of coffee capsules, so I was able to drink it in the morning. The accommodation was also available on Netflix, so it was fun to choose. The host contacted me very quickly, so there was no discomfort during my stay. They brought me plenty of towels, and I was able to wash them for free. Thank you for also giving me toothpaste. They also provided a parking space, so I was able to park for free.

I loved it', 'Overall, this place barely met expectations. Here‚Äôs my points on issues I had:\n1. Host needs to state that there can be up to 3~4 other guests on the same floor at any given time. This place felt like a dormitory.\n2. The house has very, very thin walls. The floors & walls resonate sound extremely well.\n3. The room I stayed in was right next to the kitchen AND bathroom. With 3-4 other guests, this creates a rather loud awakening during morning and night.\n4. The host should state that there‚Äôs also a daycare center on the first floor. While this didn‚Äôt cause any problems, it‚Äôs information I would‚Äôve appreciated beforehand.\n5. There‚Äôs only hole in the wall type of restaurants around the area. No chains like Starbucks or Chipotle.\n6. Road conditions around the house are dilapidated. Very bumpy roads and the house is on a one way street. Theres also close to a 8-10 minute drive from/to the main highway ‚Äî this is variable depending on traffic.\nBesides these points, the house itself is kept cool with AC running at all times. Kit hen/bathroom/common area are kept clean. As shown in the photos the room has a bed, TV and desk. I just wish I had more information about the place before signing up for this place.', 'Terrible place to stay... Good location with restaurants, supermarkets and shops nearby.

It‚Äôs hard to find parking in New York but Erika was very kind and allowed me to park in her driveway with no additional cost.

The place was really clean and the shower was great. I had to leave my bag on the last day at the apartment after I checked out, as my flight wasn't till later, and Win was very supportive of that. The place is also very centrally foodwise - if you like Mexican food there are lots of choices almost at the doorstep as well as other cuisines a little further on. The subway is a 17-18 minute walk, which was great and took me to LIC and Manhattan, and the bus only a couple of minutes walk which takes you to La Ghuardia Airport in around 20 minutes.

If you need a space to crash that is near either of these, definitely a good bang for your buck. We didn't use the shared space (kitchen or living room) so we can't comment on either of those.

You immediately feel comfy, when you enter the apartment. The neighborhood feels quite safe. The view is marvellous. Unfortunately, the noise from the street was a problem for the one of us, who slept in the street-adjacent bedroom. For visiting Manhattan the public busses and the ferry are the best options. I would not recommend ride-services or cabs, as there are high charges for crossing the NY/NJ stateline and because of the toll for the Lincoln tunnel.

The location is perfect too, with the Path, grocery stores, the waterfront, and Washington Street all being just a ten minute walk or less away.

I would have preferred that keys were in a lock box, as I felt a bit pressured to check in at a time that worked best for the host.\n- It is a basement and folks much taller than 6'1 (my height) may struggle as there is a pipe that runs the length of the basement over the bed and kitchenette.\n- Cell service is limited, so go outside for better data or use the wifi.\n- It's a 1 1/2-2 hour public transit ride from Manhattan, FYI!\nBORDERLINE- host texts a lot"", 'In love with the decorations, made it feel at home.

The furnishings are cheap looking and very used. The picture does not reflect accurately the furnishings inside. The outside garden is also filled with cheap dirty furniture. The garden itself is dirty, it looks like it hasn't been cleaned in a very long time. There's nothing inspiring about the garden which could and should be a great feature of the apartment. The blinds on the windows are broken; the mishmash of furnishings are old, torn or falling apart."", ""We had a wonderful weekend at Marty's place.

You immediately feel comfy, when you enter the apartment. The neighborhood feels quite safe. The view is marvellous. Unfortunately, the noise from the street was a problem for the one of us, who slept in the street-adjacent bedroom. For visiting Manhattan the public busses and the ferry are the best options. I would not recommend ride-services or cabs, as there are high charges for crossing the NY/NJ stateline and because of the toll for the Lincoln tunnel.

We appreciated the luggage storage before our flight after check out. I saw some reviews with concerns about the location in regards to the metro stop. However, I felt like as long as you mind your business, you will be fine. We road the metro at midnight with no issues.

Thanks!', ""We had an excellent stay! It was great to visit NYC like a local. We felt safe coming and going during daylight hours and enjoyed exploring the neighborhood. We didn't push our luck at night and took ride shares home after dark, but that was out of an abundance of caution.\nThe apartment is clean and neat and Jesse has covered every possible question about how to enjoy the space. It is an old apartment in NY, so there are some tradeoffs. The stairs to the loft are narrow and a bit steep. The AC is supplied by a window unit that does a great job in the bedroom but doesn't help much in the bathroom or common areas. If you need central air, better to stay in a hotel. We didn't find either of these things to be problematic, and if anything added to the experience of living like a New Yorker for a few days.\nJess is the most responsive and proactive host I have encountered to date. I absolutely hope to be able to stay here again! Would love to bring friends and rent both suites together!"", ""Jesse is an incredibly gracious host.

It affected me too much to have to inhale that substance everywhere, it has been a negative point of that big city, and it's unfortunate.\nAll in all, it's been a beautiful experience with the contrast of the hustle and bustle of the big block of Manhattan with the humility of those Harlem and Bronx neighborhoods.\nWe really enjoyed it and saw many iconic places in record time."", 'Extraordinary place will be my choice for my next trip to New York City.']",['2 beds ¬∑ Dedicated bathroom']

I recommend making sure that it is locked when you first check-in. Noise and conversations from the occupants of the townhouse can be heard very clearly in the studio. This wasn't really a problem for me, as I was out every day and only came back at night to sleep, but if you are sensitive to noise, this might be a problem for you.\nThe kitchen is a small nook with a mini fridge and microwave, so not a functioning kitchen that you can prepare meals in.

Of all the sites I‚Äôve seen posted on Airbnb and the one apartment I actually stayed prior to living with Joaquin and Jon, their place is without question the best. Really it has been like staying in a five-star hotel. I should know because as a stylist for many well-known people, I have stayed at some of the most elegant hotels in the world.\n\nEverything is well appointed from design, to furnishings to amenities ‚Äì such that indeed makes you feel right at home.

This is a truly unique home, with an individual, creative and well-defined, sophisticated sense of aesthetics and design.\n\nJoaquin and Jon live on a two-floor duplex. The kitchen/dining room area is beautifully and expertly laid out ‚Äì perfect for chefs and people who enjoy entertaining. It would be ideal to host a cooking TV show in their kitchen ‚Äì a new business idea for JoaquinJ\n\nThe Airbnb quarters are on the second floor where I enjoyed having a generously sized bedroom and modern private bathroom. The bedroom is blessed with three large bay windows that let in a lot of sunlight. The mattress is very firm and comfortable for a restful night of sleep. From the sheets, to the towels to the furnishings, the entire place, including my room and bathroom, are immaculate. I was continually amazed by just how beautifully and expertly designed every corner of the house is no matter where I looked.\n\nJoaquin and Jon are very special, kind people who were respectful and solicitous of my needs and concerns. They addressed every issue I raised. Joaquin is an amazing cook, with an amazing sense of aesthetics. He is highly creative with a strong sense of style while at the same time is extremely professional. As an attorney he gave me a lot of advice in relocating here from Greece. Over a short period of time, Joaquin and I became friends ‚Äì cooking together, shopping and learning about culture and art. We made a habit of talking over coffee every morning. It was a lot of fun sharing Greek cuisine with Joaquin and Jon. In turn, I learned a lot about American sports from Jon, who also was very helpful. I also appreciated how they both respected my privacy.\n\nI want to thank Joaquin and Jon for opening up their home and their hearts to me, welcoming me into this country and NYC. I look to continuing my friendship with them. Without reservation, this is the place to stay!!', ""Joaquin and Jon have a beautiful home, and two very sweet dogs. As others have commented, I came into the city early one morning and Joaquin had coffee and breakfast waiting for me when I arrived, which was a welcome treat. Joaquin clearly works very hard to keep his home and garden an inviting space, to great effect.\n\nThere is a subway stop just 2 blocks away, which makes it simple to get just about anywhere in the city. I stayed with them while in the city on business, and it took me about 40-45 minutes to get from their home to the Flatiron District for work each day. Their neighborhood is a bit south of the more recently gentrified Brooklyn neighborhoods such as Park Slope, Williamsburg, etc., but the subway gives reasonably quick access to just about anywhere. This is important since dining options and sights/attractions are not as good in the immediately surrounding neighborhood as they are further north in Brooklyn or on Manhattan.

Joaquin and Jon‚Äôs home was BEAUTIFUL! Very thoughtfully decorated and our bedroom was he perfect size. Also, our bed was comfortable, sheets were extra soft and there was an Apple TV setup so we could enjoy Netflix, Hulu, HBO, etc. The 3rd floor skylights are also so nice and I don‚Äôt think (though I could be wrong) they made it into any of the listing‚Äôs pictures! Such a nice stay. Thanks guys!', ""Joaquin's home is special.

Glad that I did.\nJoaquin was very responsive and detailed whenever I asked something prior to my arrival. I did not find hard time locating the place, it is just a 5-minute walk from the nearest subway station. Joaquin then briefed me about the parts of the house where I can get access of, the nearby interesting places, etc. It's always a delight talking to him. Then I met their very adorable dog, Molly. I really enjoyed playing with her. She's so sweet. Later, I met Jon, who is equally accommodating and responsive as Joaquin.

There is also a nice patio in back with a pretty garden.\n\nIn the same block we found a convenient supermarket, a deli with pretty good buffet and a well-sized park (Sunset Park) with an astonishing view of Manhattan. The subway station is only two blocks away and only takes about 20 minutes to Manhattan.\n\nJoaquin is a great host: helpful, warm and interesting; concerned about our well being; but respectful of our space too. He offered us a delicious coffee every morning and, if you ask, as he did for us, he will cook a great breakfast too. I should also mention he offered to do the laundry in their washing machine--very convenient for long stays. Joaquin also provided convenient tips to enjoy the city much more. We also shared several interesting conversations with him, even ocasionally with a glass of wine.

It's just a 10-minute walk away from PATH station.\nHowever, we couldn't rate it a perfect 5 stars due to a few issues:\n1.The property was on the ground floor of a 4-story brownstone building, and the hosts resided directly above, sharing the backyard. Unfortunately, the lack of privacy in the backyard made it unusable.\n2.We were consistently disrupted by early morning noise, around 6:30 am, likely caused by children running on the second-floor. Given our time zone difference (traveling from the west coast), this was quite inconvenient.\n3.Street construction during our stay led to water shut-offs one morning, delaying our activities. The host did apologize for this inconvenience.\n4.We faced an unfriendly stance from the host regarding our service dog.

She is incredibly sweet and helpful and busy unpacking boxes so there is some clutter as you come in but the space you have is amazing. Its a separate bedroom and another room attached. Its a one flight walk up to your floor. The bathroom is kept clean, you have access to the kitchen and the location cant be beat. Few blocks in any direction you get anything you need. Its surprisingly quiet for being in the middle of the slope. Beautiful tree lined block but its Brooklyn, so if you have a car parking can be challenging. All in all a great stay, I would stay again."", 'The neighborhood is easily accessible by F. Manhattan subway is 20-30 minutes away. In the neighborhood there are all the amenities.

Thanks, Albert!', ""This was a great location for my friends who live nearby and for getting into the city. The space itself is great--a large anteroom with television and a cozy bedroom. Each door has a lock if you want privacy--I think you get a room key but I never used (or tried) it. Staying here was a true Airbnb experience--it is someone's house, and I felt like I was visiting an aunt. Christmas decorations were going up so there was a lot going on but everyone was very friendly and responsive--really very much like family! The rest of the place is chockfull of furniture, pictures, memorabilia--it's someone's house after all. It also has lots of plants, which was nice. I also found my rooms very clean and not dusty, which can be tough in NY. There was no second lodger and the person living there was out for much of my stay so it felt very private.\nIf you want to go into the city or if you take the train to the place (as I did), I would recommend the 9th Street/4th Ave stop--it's about the same distance as the Prospect Ave stop but for some reason just felt easier to get to. Also it has both the F and the R in case one has track changes. Lots of restaurants and shops on Fifth and Seventh Aves."", ""The accommodations are accurate. Lots to grab your attention and he feeling of a visit with family... We were really grateful for a friendly welcome to us last minute travelers.

Albert had fresh water bottles for me upon arrival, which was a very nice surprise. The bathroom was super clean, which I greatly appreciated. If you are very sensitive to noise, I would recommend inquiring about if there are any other guests on the 2nd floor.

I want to laugh while writing this review, of all the ways this hotel could make a young woman traveling alone feel unsafe - and how much it absolutely sucked.\n1.) it was totally not clean. And by ‚Äúnot clean‚Äù‚Ä¶ I mean, cigarette burned carpet - cracked sink - totally grimy and basically impossible to walk on without feeling gross.\n2.) it was either REALLY hot or REALLY cold in the room. There was little to no good temperature control, and I felt like I was suffocating. The window didn‚Äôt open, there was no fresh air.\n3. The sheets were uncomfortable. Itchy and scratchy. Thin. The comforter was insubstantial, and to add insult to injury, the bed was kind‚Äôve stiff.\n4.) Coffee in the morning was absolutely not even coffee. You know that instant stuff that tastes sort‚Äôve like horse piss that you drink when you‚Äôre on a camping trip? If you decide to stay here I‚Äôd suggest Bring YOUR own coffee because that crappy camping coffee it‚Äôs about 3 notches above what this hotel brews up in their toilet bowl in the morning.\n4. I was on the 12th floor. As a single woman. There was no security around at all. Also the smoke alarm in my room ... had WIRES STICKING OUT OF IT. It was not a working smoke alarm, and I‚Äôm pretty sure this is ILLEGAL according to any state law. To top it off the hallway smelled like frat boy vomit and cigarette smoke. I was also fearful that someone could break into my room at any time.\n5. Customer service / reception was pretty rude. Not the most rude people in the world - I wouldn‚Äôt want to work at this dump, either...but I would hardly call the attitude of the people at the front desk warm. After a five hour flight and a hell-ish journey through JFK, all I wanted was for the dude at the front desk to be kind - but was disappointed with his lack of warmth. There are way better places to stay. I would NOT spend my money here.']",['2 guests ¬∑ 1 bedroom ¬∑ 1 bed ¬∑ 1 private bath']

The kitchen and living is absolutely amazing. There isn't an entertainment system such as a television for those who care for it, we were fine playing our music.

We had a lot of 4 of us, with one room per head for the boys and a double bedroom for us. A great surprise is the TWO bathrooms: one full, and one with a toilet and small sink. Maybe there's only one small flaw: on the backyard side you hear a little 24-hour noise from a restaurant, but it's isolated from great new double-glazed windows. There's air conditioning.\nThe property is in a quiet and bourgeois area, literally 100 meters from the F subway that leads to Manhattan, through Broolkyn.

We were 4 coworkers and it was perfect. If someone goes with their partner, they could also have stayed comfortably. It has light, good ventilation, very comfortable bathroom and service. They were very friendly, very quick to respond and everything works perfectly with them.

I\'ll definitely be back!', 'The room served our purpose well. Ample space and nice bathroom with spacious shower. Bed was very comfortable and the AC was much appreciated. Close to many restaurants & coffee shops. It is worth reminding that this unit does not have a private entrance - the door is just inside the shared entrance & hallway & is adjacent to the host‚Äôs living space. So any talking in the next room is heard through the walls. Much appreciated Marie-Line‚Äôs quick communication & willingness to help us out with last minute check-in.', 'We loved staying here. Everything was as described, and even better than I was expecting. Entry to the room was discreet and private enough that we felt comfortable coming and going, never in the way. The street is quiet, we slept great and felt very safe. We enjoyed the 5 minute walk to get coffee each morning, also close to several great cafes and restaurants. Conveniently located near the subway, even with our luggage, it was easy to get to. We will keep this listing on the rotation for future visits to the city!', 'Great stay.

Hosts were polite and quiet, and it was easy to come and go with privacy.', 'I was content with my stay at Marie‚Äôs place. It is a private room (with a bathroom) on the ground floor in a brownstone.

I think value for money is spot on!', 'I can see why Marie Line‚Äôs place is usually fully booked - it‚Äôs a well-appointed, comfortable and clean studio in a great Brooklyn neighborhood with plenty of restaurants and stores within walking distance.

Warm and cosy!', ""This is a lovely place to stay in Brooklyn. This was my first experience renting a private room rather than an entire unit. To my surprise, the room was extremely private and felt like a generous hotel room. The room has a kitchenette and a bathroom attached. You never have to share any common areas with the owners unless you'd like to.\nThe entire unit was clean, especially the bathroom. The shower was wonderful! The window air unit conditioner was more than sufficient. Marie-Line was very flexible with our check-in and check-out times.\nThis is a lovely place to stay in Brooklyn. It is more affordable than a full unit. Additionally, we did not feel like we were contributing to the housing crisis in NYC since we were renting a room rather than a full unit. It's in a great location and was perfect for our first trip back since moving from Brooklyn over a year ago.\nThanks Marie-Line!"", 'Everything was perfect. The location, the accommodation and the hospitality. Thank you Marie Line.', 'Sweet clean place located in an excellent neighborhood near several subway lines. Also, it was on the ground floor so no stars to climb!

She was very friendly and helpful.\nThe room was nice and clean and the bed was very comfortable. AC was available, which was appreciated this hot summer week. The bathroom was also clean and fresh, with access to hand soap, body wash, and shampoo/conditioner. In the kitchen area there was a fridge, kettle, coffee maker. One\ncloset is available, with hangers, shelves and iron. Also an umbrella was available to borrow.\nThe street was very quiet and pleasant, yet close to cafes, restaurants and bars. Subway was available with a few minutes walking distance.\nWe had an incredible time at Park Slope and can warmly recommend Marie Line's accommodation!"", 'Marie-Line was a great host.

Beautiful bathroom. Highly recommend.', ""The studio was exactly as described. We shared a front door but there was no issue about privacy. Marie Line was helpful and knowing that she was there if needed was a real bonus. Park Slope is a delightful area with 5th and 7th's amazing collection of shops and places to eat. A perfect base from which to explore."", 'Everything was absolutely great! There was extra towels and trash bags. Bathroom and bed/mattress were pristine. Host was also very proactive in communications when we had a plane delay. 7-10 minute walk away from subway entrance.', 'As the home is located on a narrow road, and very close to a blind turn, the safest place to park is on the grass directly in front of the home, so that you can get both tires off the roadway.', ""Very nice stay in Brooklyn at Marie-Line's. The location is ideal to find a little calm in NY, located close to many restaurants and supermarkets, and subway stations that serve Manhattan.

It was beautiful, spacious, quiet, and thoughtfully designed to meet any guest's needs, including a useful food prep area, a large handicapped accessible bathroom, TV, lots of outlets to charge all of our devices, a desk for working, two large chairs that can be pulled together to make a sofa, and the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in! The location was convenient to everything, as well, with a short 7 minute walk to either the Q/B or 2/3 trains, and lots of wonderful restaurants to choose from just a block away on 7th or 5th Avenues. (GrubHub and Whole Foods will deliver food to you here, as well!) Marie-Line was a great host, and very quick to respond to my messages.

Would definitely book again.', 'Perfect place. Perfect area. Bonus - a comfortable bed!', ""I stayed at Marie-Line's place for 3 nights and it was a nice place to stay. I always love staying in Park Slope - safe, easy to get into the city, walkable, lots to do, and great places to eat close by. Marie-Line's place was clean, close to transit, private, and had everything you could need. In particular, I appreciated the private bathroom, free water bottles, iron, hair dryer, fan, and kettle. As a few other reviews mentioned, the pictures make the room seem bright and fresh but, in reality, it was a bit tired and there isn't a lot of natural light. I also found it was really hot in there at night but turning the fan on made a big difference. And finally, if you're a light sleeper, some of the noise from people walking by (on a Friday or Saturday night) could be a concern but ear plugs or turning on the fan can help with that. All in all, the last few things I mentioned here weren't a big deal for me and I appreciated having a clean, safe, comfortable and affordable place to stay."", 'We had a wonderful stay! Location is perfect - 5 minutes to the subway with direct lines to Manhattan, two breakfast places on the corner, quiet and peaceful at night. The bed was super comfortable, the place very clean.

Flexible check-in and check-out when possible. The apartment is perfectly located right next to the subway 3 stops from Manhattan. Recommended."", 'A stylish pad, in a great area, with a cool cocoon-like loft bed.', 'Absolutely recommendable, I felt totally comfortable during my stay and everything was just perfect. Thomas is a fantastic host, very friendly and helpful. The loft is very nice and more than lovingly decorated, everything is very clean. There is a roof terrace with an incredible view. The area is great and the subway connection to Manhattan is easy and fast.', 'Great stylish space - perfect place to crash in Brooklyn', ""Thomas's place is excellent, one of the best Airbnbs in NYC, and he is a great host. I'd highly recommend staying here for anyone visiting the city."", 'Upon entering Thomas‚Äô place I immediately fell in love with the beautiful, eclectic interior design. Each room was styled with attention to detail featuring well-maintained plants.\nThe place was easy to get to via an elevator and there were local train stations within walking distance to get to all boroughs of NYC.\nFacilities included gym, laundromat, courtyard and a rooftop which provided stunning views of the Manhattan skyline.\nThomas was attentive to my needs and responsive. He only stayed 3 nights but was available to be contacted when he was away.\nThe main thing to be concerned about (depending on physical ability) is that the bed is in a loft about 3 metres (10 feet) high, and climbable using collapsible steps. This was not a deterrent for me but is the main thing to consider if you were less able-bodied.\nI grew such an emotional attachment to the place that it was hard to leave! I highly recommend this place and would definitely return in future travels. Brilliant, Thomas!', ""I had really great time in Thomas's apartment. Nice interior, very clean and most of all, nice neighborhood. Very recommended with a resonable price. Thomas was really kind, thank you for sweet greetings and nice conversations:)"", 'The space is incredible, location is perfect, and Thomas is amazing. Couldn‚Äôt have been better!', 'Great host, Great area , great hospitality . Highly reccomended.', 'Thomas was a very accommodating and great host. He went above and beyond to make sure I had a great trip in Brooklyn. His place was beautiful and original!', 'Thomas‚Äôs home is fricking beautiful! Every piece of furniture and decor is so intentionally placed to make you feel comfortable and relaxed. His place is in such a good neighborhood, super close to the L train, super close to nice restaurants, and it feels very safe as well. Thomas is a very nice man and he made me feel so welcomed in New York!', 'It was reasonably far from Manhattan, so I was able to rest comfortably when I came back to the accommodation during my trip. The neighborhood is cleaner than Manhattan. It was close to the station, so it was easy to get around.\nThe bedroom is on the second floor, and the ladder was a little scary for me, but it was cozy.\nI liked that the temperature and lighting were free to adjust in a private space and to be able to use the iMac.', 'Great spot! The office/lofted bed was plenty of space and the apartment is beautiful. Good location near L train. Great host very easy to get along with.', 'Thomas accommodated us when we have an emergency need for Airbnb.

Thomas was a lovely and accomodating host and we had wonderful, enlightening and interesting conversations. Of course, the place itself is stylish and clean and about a 4 minute walk to Graham avenue subway stop on the L line - so great location.\nDefinitely recommend.', ""All is good and can't fault it."", ""Thomas' apartment is one of the most beautiful homes that I have stayed in! Impeccably designed and just a joy to stay in. The apartment is in a great location that is very walkable to everything Williamsburg and an easy L train ride away from Manhattan.

I would highly recommend and thoroughly enjoyed my stay there."", 'Thomas is a welcoming host with a beautiful apartment. The apartment leaves nothing to be desired, it is quiet, there is a pleasant atmosphere and the apartment is well connected to the L line. Thank you very much Thomas, I would come again and again.', 'We really enjoyed staying at this beautiful loft! The location is really amazing - so close to the train and with great places to eat around the neighborhood. It was our little hub after exploring Manhattan :)\nIf you want to stay in Brooklyn this is definitely it!\nThe space is really unique, with the bed up in the loft and so many fun decorations everywhere. It was really great to chat with Thomas as well; we had some deep conversations which were great.\nThe terrace is spectacular and I wish we had more time to hang out there.\nOverall a great stay in a unique space. Thank you!', 'Decent price for what appears to be a nice apartment. But you get what you pay for.\nThe room itself affords very little personal space. The room is cluttered with books, knick knacks, and seemingly random objects occupying every surface and shelf, meaning there‚Äôs very limited space for one‚Äôs own personal effects.\nThe bed is marked in the listing as a queen, but I am only 6‚Äô and I had to sleep diagonally to fit without having to bend my legs. There‚Äôs also a metal pole that that protrudes just under the fabric right where your head should rest, which makes for an uncomfortable sleeping situation.\nThe desk setup is odd. Most of the space on the desk is occupied by the host‚Äôs own computer, and the expectation is that guests use that to work, using the guest login. I don‚Äôt know many people for whom this would be a feasible system, much less preferred - after a year+ of pandemic, anyone working remotely has their own laptop. This made for a cramped desk. The wifi router beneath the desk makes an extremely high pitched whirring sound, which requires one to wear headphones while working. Not a great working setup.\nThe lack of personal space continues when you exit the room, as the host‚Äôs own work desk is right outside. He is there working and taking calls during the day, and the walls are very thin, leaving little sense of privacy.\nThe common space is a cramped obstacle course. I tripped and cut my shin on the elevated dining console while getting water in the night. The fridge is 90% full with the hosts own stuff.\nThe host is very early to bed and early to rise (grinding coffee at 6am and in bed with lights out at 10pm). I came home late my second night staying here, and despite taking great care to make as little noise as possible (removing my shoes outside, going silently to the room then the bathroom, then immediately to bed), he confronted me the the next day claiming I woke him up, and was passive aggressive about my comings and goings the rest of my stay. I offered to buy him earplugs, but he declined.\nI changed my plans to end my stay early partly because I was uncomfortable with the communication style and incompatible schedules. When I attempted to update my reservation, free up the nights I was no longer staying and allow him to get another guest in, he messaged me in the app that I had ‚Äúput him on the spot‚Äù and had created an uncomfortable situation for him.\nI found living up to the expectations of the host not to be worth the low cost of the room. I regret not getting my own place. I would recommend this AirBnB only to someone traveling on business whose intended hours match the early to bed, early to rise sleep schedule of the host. On the plus side, it is very cheap, and the neighborhood is lovely.', 'Thomas was an amazing host. His place was designer eye candy from top to bottom! The location was ideal to explore Brooklyn and there were amazing restaurants at every turn. After my busy days Thomas‚Äôs place was a peaceful retreat, with a comfy bed! I got lucky to stay there!', ""I had a great time staying at Thomas' beautifully designed loft. When I arrived Thomas greeted me with a warm welcome and led me through the apartment - it's just as advertised. Great location, Williamsburg, a hipster area with a quick connection to Manhattan. A supermarket is just around the corner, and the kitchen is well-equipped, in case you like cooking; otherwise, plentiful restaurants in the area. Note: you need to climb the ladder to get to the bed."", 'The place is beautiful and stylishly decorated, in a safe neighborhood. However, the bed is a steep staircase, which is a bit impractical, especially at night. You have to be quite fit, tall and careful.\nThis was the infrastructure and I think you can hardly imagine it from the pictures and description until you really see it. So far so fair.\nSince it is a loft, I often felt like host Tom was disturbed by my presence. Once he complained about cooking even though I had only used a little olive oil.\nOn the one hand, he wants you to keep ""quiet"" and be quiet from 10 pm to 8 am, on the other hand, it is not really desirable if you cook at home and when he came home after 10 pm, he slammed the door loudly and was also not exactly considerate.\nThe communication was rather uncomfortable, and it gave the impression that he doesn\'t like guests. I was ultimately happy to be able to leave', 'Great location - great host!!', 'I had a really great stay. Awesome place, awesome location.', 'Thomas was one the best hosts I‚Äôve ever had! Kind, welcoming, available, warm, and a beautiful space to boot.', ""Thomas's place is amazing! It's exactly what you see in the images and tbh even better. The location is great.

Thankssssssss SUPER RECOMMEND !', 'Thomas is a thoughtful, responsive host and his place is wonderful ! thanks!', 'The place is beautiful and stylish. Thomas is a great host, easy to communicate with and really polite. The loft is the real Brooklyn experience that you see in movies. The bed located upstairs that can be accessed with the ladder is really comfy. The office which was available for myself was just perfect size and really private. The views from the rooftop of the building are really amazing and for me worked as an extension of the flat since I would grab dinner upstairs and watch the sun going down behind the manhattan skyline. The location is also great, super close from granham station which gives you access to the city quickly as well as few steps away from downtown williansburg, which offers amazing restaurants and sight view to manhattan.\nOverall I have a great time and would definitely recommend it. Thanks Thomas :)', ""A unique experience, Thomas' house is a timeless gem in the quiet and trendy Williamsburg neighborhood. Furnished in detail and equipped with all comforts.

He was always easy to reach and had great suggestions for places to go. There's lots of great food, coffee spots, and shopping options right outside the apartment. His home is very unique and perfectly styled. It was nice coming back to his space after a full day out in the city.\nThe location is perfect as it was right by the L to take you into Manhattan. Just note that the L is under construction with limited service (closed on weekends and shuts down at night), but the location was still great to explore other areas outside Manhattan.\nI'd definitely recommend staying with Thomas."", 'Thomas was very accommodating and helpful with my stay if I needed anything and was communicative as well.

The room is up a ladder, which for some may take some getting used to - for me, it was no problem whatsoever. The bed and bedding was excellent and I had a sound nights sleep every night.\nI cannot rate Thomas and his apartment any higher. Definitely THE place to stay as the location is perfect for either exploring Brooklyn - or for heading into Manhattan. You are a couple of blocks from the L line subway, that takes to straight to Union Square where you can pick up other lines to go either uptown of downtown. Regardless, a short journey.\nThank you for being such a great host Thomas!', 'Thomas was an excellent host. Very kind, friendly, and hospitable.

The Subway station was just over a block away and the area was safe, even late at night!\nHis home had an elegant and charming decor. I especially enjoyed eating breakfast on the terrace, overlooking a beautiful garden. My own bedroom was spacious, full of large windows, beautifully decorated. Also it was perfectly organised and clean, as was my private bathroom.

We would definitely recommend :)', ""The whole experience with Jon and Joaquin was absolutely amazing, from the moment that our booking was accepted communication was excellent. Joaquin offered tips and advice in advance of our stay which we found extremely helpful. Our room was simply breathtaking, it sits on the third floor of an approx one hundred year old Brownstone with its own private bathroom which was also beautiful, shampoo, conditioner and shower gel were supplied for us to use if we wished. Jon and Joaquin have renovated their home to an extremely high standard with passion and sensitivity to reflect its period charm, it is the perfect balance of old and new. You will be amazed at how beautiful it is, you are also free to enjoy their garden which is equally as beautiful. Their home is filled with light, love and laughter and we feel privileged to have been able to share their home albeit for a short time. I think we made quite good friends with Maggie and Bodhi, two very laid back dogs that it was also a pleasure to get to know. We were given so many helpful tips from where to eat, art galleries to visit the best use of the subway, you can only get this sort of advice from the people who live there. The subway was only two blocks away and felt very safe, you can purchase a 7 day unlimited pass for 30 dollars which is excellent value. There were endless restaurants, deli's and supermarkets nearby, some of the best sandwiches we have ever had. At the top of their street sits Sunset Park with a view that will render you speechless day or night, the park is used by many of the locals from walking their dogs to families using the children's area or vast groups enjoying their early morning exercising. We felt very sad to leave such a wonderful place but most importantly to leave two people who made us feel so welcome and have left us with the most incredible memories we can't thank you enough."", ""Joaquin is a very lovely host who is eager to give advice and suggestions and is a really fun character - we're so happy to have met him and stayed in his beautiful artistic home with Jon, who was equally lovely, and their soppy old dog, Maggie. It was a peaceful haven away from the city. Well connected with two subways both within 10 mins walk. Comfy mattress. Cool enough to sleep well due to fan in the room. Powerful and refreshing shower. Gorgeous little garden to have a morning coffee in. Easy to tiptoe around if coming home late due to thick rugs throughout the house. Highly recommend staying in this home. We hope to go back!"", ""Joaquin and Jon were wonderful hosts. We would not have expected to meet such attentive and interesting people of the heart in our vacation.\nFrom the first moment we felt like we were with friends.\nIn a dreamy home full of selected art and exciting little stories from around the world.\nNew York wouldn't have been half as beautiful without them and the cheerful woolly Molly.\nWe can't wait to see you again here in Brooklyn or maybe Berlin.\nThank you for your unforgettable hospitality!"", ""Staying at Joaquin's place was magical and so much more than I could have asked for. His home is immaculate, a work of art, and just overall peaceful. If you opt for breakfast, you will not regret it! It's also close to public transit that will take you swiftly into Manhattan , so many restaurants, and Prospect Park, which is lovely. I would highly recommend staying here, I will definitely be back :)"", 'This beautiful home in Brooklyn is an absolutely wonderful place to stay.

I will definitely come back!', ""Joaquin is a superhost, attentive and thoughtful. He went above and beyond what I expected, for example he loaned me his stroller for the week to help me haul my work stuff around, made delicious coffee each morning and tea at night.

The apartment was very clean, including the shared kitchen space, and the bathroom was also very clean despite sharing with the other 3 rooms. Clearly Amy is trying hard to make this a nicely run AirBnB property, because she seems to try hard to make the place nice for her guests.

For our first family trip in New York we couldn't of better dream! As a first step, we were hesitant to stay in our 12 nights at the hotel. So before the brownstone we had spent two nights at the hotel to enjoy the views from the East River on the skycrapers. Choosing to stay at Jenny's was the best decision we could make. Feeling at home in a typical house bordering Central Park is an amazing feeling. The house is beautiful. The two bedrooms (actually an entire floor with the bathroom) are splendid, impeccably clean and very comfortable. The entire 1st floor (tea room, breakfast room, fridge, coffee machine...) is available to guests, which gives the impression of having the house to yourself ( which is a little real). Unfortunately we didn't see much Jenny. She welcomed us with great kindness and immediately put us at ease (her discretion is remarkable). The area is nice with Central Park 150m away, nice restaurants (Bella Luna, good Italian, hearty and reasonable price level, the bodrum, very good Turkish...). There is also a whole food market 10 minutes to the north, good supermarket plan with lots of choices and the possibility of self-service composing your salad, hot dishes to pay for by weight (tjs more expensive than in France but real good plan to eat well, good and reasonable for the wallet). In fact, we can find this chain everywhere in the city, we can eat on site what we have bought in self-service, here no tip!

Jenny and Emily responded to all our queries promptly and very informatively which supported us in making the decision to book their particular townhouse. All I can say is we definitely made the right decision and were so privileged to stay in a beautiful traditional brownstone townhouse, two blocks from both Central Park and the subway. Jenny was there to meet us on our arrival and was just so warm and lovely, telling us about the history of her beautifully-maintained characterful home, recommending restaurants, theatre and music events whilst inviting us to use the coffee maker, kettle, water cooler, toaster and fridge for the duration of our stay (provided in the foyer and sitting area at entry level to the property). The two bedrooms on the next floor up easily accommodated three separate sleepers in very comfortable beds fitted with quality bed linen and the separate shower/ toilet on the same floor was spotlessly-maintained and well-equipped with towels, a hairdryer etc. There are plenty of cupboards and closets available in both bedrooms and also hanging space in the entrance hall, adding to the home from home feel and reducing the inevitable clutter that arises from three 50-something year olds sharing a space! The property is an absolute haven of peace and tranquility in a stylish residential street of brownstone townhouses in the midst of Manhattan and the setting or the property itself could not be more perfect.

Beautiful and Cosy home in a very peaceful neighbourhood away from the buzz. The house has everything you need for an enjoyable stay. The place has eateries and supermarket at a walking distance. Bus stop is only 2 mins walk.\nMaissel is very kind and proactive in offering directions and suggestions.', 'My siblings and I stayed at Maissel‚Äôs for a 3 night stop to visit NY city! It was such a great place and location. Easy to get back and forth on transit, we just parked the car and didn‚Äôt have to worry about driving and parking in the city!

The mattresses are great. Everything in the apartment is in a stylish state. The host responds immediately and in a positive way, very helpful and came to us above and beyond. For those who care about windows in the apartment, the only windows that open - we found in the living room. Heating is good. There's not a lot of noise in the apartment, the road didn't bother us."", 'Great place, beautiful furnishing, clean, and spacious.

Close to trains and ferry‚Äôs to get to NYC.', 'Booked this with trips to NYC in mind and it was quite easy to drive and ferry into the city.

Easy check in and check out!', 'Super adorable place! Very clean and comfortable place, would rent it again!', 'Very comfortable stay. Spacious enough, well used. It looks modern and functional. Good equipment. We approach with the choice, we recommend it. The bus to New York is fast.', 'We stayed for 4 nights while sightseeing in NYC. The NJ Transit bus stop to NYC is a 1-2 minute walk around the corner and the busses come every couple minutes. Easy to get to the Port Authority Bus Terminal in about 10 minutes - then can hop on the subway to anywhere in NYC. Coming back from NYC, Maissel‚Äôs place is the first stop. We were able to park and leave our car on the street right in front of the condo during the whole stay and use public transportation.\nMaissel was 100% responsive - we had no issues during our stay.\nThe condo is on the small side, but lovely! With 3 adults, we managed just fine and again, we weren‚Äôt really home during the day. It was immaculate and seemed newly remodeled with new appliances. I would highly recommend if you are looking for a convenient and affordable spot to visit NYC.', 'We could not have been more pleased with our stay. We were back and forth to NYC and this was perfectly located. Every response was prompt and thorough. We even received suggestions in advance of our trip for places to visit and things to do, as well as links up on our arrival for other potential needs we may have once there. The place was beautiful and exactly as described. We would definitely return!', 'Everything great, great location and great connection to the city with parking for 2 cars. Highly recommended for a Ny visit', 'We were able to stay at a reasonable price for close proximity to central New York.\nIt was difficult to pick up the key, but they were kind enough to respond kindly to every other trouble.', 'Great stay, great location, loved the place. Maissel was kind enough to resupply toiletries.', 'I took a little weekend trip up to NYC and stumbled upon Maissel condo! Seriously this place is so freaking nice and lovely. Felt like home. Beds were comfy & the place is really modern with nice marble flooring in the kitchen and the super bright LEDs they have on the celling! But wait‚Ä¶ that shower tho! Man oh man that shower is AMAZING!!\nLocation is Fantasist. Not far at all from Manhattan. We took public transportation the whole time we were there and it‚Äôs 1 bus an 1 stop and boom your in Garment district! Next to all the attractions including time square, MSG, an etc\nCommunicating with maissel was super east and was very quick with responses - also made sure we had a easy check in processes an we got everything settled down.\nAll in all I would 1000% defiantly book this place again!!!', ""Apartment was as described - clean, well maintained and practical. Somewhat dark through a few windows and noisy. Street noise was always heard. Small bathroom. But everything was very clean upon our arrival and Maissel quickly rules on questions and also communicates proactively. NY very easy to reach by bus (matching cash hold -3$ pp - no card payment. Return only with a pre-purchased ticket). Parking a car is quite difficult, but Maissel provides a visitor's parking permit. Some restaurants and supermarkets can be reached partly on foot or in a few minutes. Be sure to visit Hamilton Park at night - great views of Manhattan."", 'Very clean and you can ride well to Manhattan with the bus. Unfortunately for not Newyorker to come back from Manhattan quite complicated.\nFrom Newark Airport, perfectly accessible by Uber about 25¬ß.', 'Maissel‚Äôs place was the best airbnb we have stayed at. The apartment was super clean very comfortable. The best part had to be the shower omg after a long day in NYC coming to that shower and taking warm bath was priceless. Not to mention the towels they smelled so clean. This apartment was just as described, location was walking distance to bus stop, near by restaurants, and convenience store. We would definitely stay here again. Thank you Maissel for hosting our stay.', ""We felt very comfortable, the apartment was very clean and stocked with everything you might need. Manhattan was easy to get to by bus (stop just around the corner). Before heading back to Union City, check Port Authority for the gate from which the bus is running. The only downside is the noise from the apartment upstairs. I think furniture goes crazy every night. Tip for the last night, the Chart House with a fantastic view on Manhattan. From Airbnb it's only about 20 min on foot. We had a fantastic week in New York and Maissel's place we can only recommend."", 'This place was so conveniently located. We were able to leave our car parked the entire stay and walk a block or two away to the bus stop. If I ever go back to NY, I‚Äôd definitely stay here. 5 star rating across the board!', 'We had a great stay! Within 10 minutes you are right in downtown New York by bus, almost in Times Square. The stay was very clean and spacious! Upon arrival, Maissel immediately sent some options for supermarkets and eateries. He tried to call during the stay to ask if everything is to your liking. I would highly recommend staying here! In a word; great.', ""Everything was great. Communication excellent. If you have a car, careful parking in the street is just for residents only. The parking lot costs $53.-!!! However, you can quickly go to the bus stop from the apartment. By the way, I've never had such a clean vacation rental apartment."", 'Late Time\nOverall, it was great except that there was no place to park when I went home.', 'Maissel is a great host, she had provided instructions to check-in first hand and it was hassle-free especially when you‚Äôre coming in at midnight. The place was well setup and beautifully decorated. There‚Äôs also a binder full of recommendations for eating, shopping and other things to do around when you‚Äôre there. My family and I were visiting NYC primarily and the proximity to the bus stop (just at the end of the block) was super handy because you‚Äôre just one stop away from PABT and Times Square. There‚Äôs a deli nearby which was great for breakfast and snack supplies. If I‚Äôm ever visiting NYC or NJ area, I would definitely like to stay here again and would recommend it to anyone who wants to do the same.', ""Location is awesome if you are visiting NYC, it's only a 10-15 minute bus ride with buses constantly going by. The place is very clean and is stocked with lots of necessities including coffee which was really nice. The bed linens were very clean and tons of bath towels were provided. The full size fridge is also nice. No washer and dryer. The double bedroom is nice, beds in there are nice. We spent every day on our feet in NYC and looked forward to rest in the evenings but the living room furniture is quite small so we had to resort to the bedrooms every evening. And I will say the upstairs person lives there and is very, very loud. Sounded like they walked back and forth and moved furniture banging around all night every night making it impossible for us to get much rest. I know this is to no fault of Maissel, but thought it should be mentioned. It may not bother everyone but it was really bothersome for us. Maissel is a great host and provides more than enough info about the area."", 'Maissel was a very accommodating host, always available and very helpful. The apartment was spacious and clean. The busstops was nearby and we were in 10 minutes at Port Authority. I can highly recommend.', 'Condo matched description/pictures. Great location to get to Manhattan.

Awesome amenities in the renovated condo and really cool rain shower head!', 'Starting with Maissel, very responsive and respectful host. Helped us with not only the check in process but also with recommendations and any questions I had.\nThe place it self is awesome. Renovated, clean, Modern, and great location. Walkable to nearby Gas station, restaurants, Walgreens, and a short walk to the water for a great view of NY city across the river.\nHighly recommend this place.', 'My family of 5 had a wonderful stay! The apartment is very clean, with all the necessities and beautifully decorated. A plus, is how easy it is to get to public transportation to travel to NYC. Maissel was a terrific host! We look forward to staying here again in the future. Highly recommend it!', 'Maissel is very helpful, we enjoyed our night in your apartment. Thank you!', ""Overall, our stay was very positive. The location was incredibly convenient, with easy access to transportation into and out of New York City via a nearby New Jersey Transit bus route. The house matched the pictures and was very clean, and the owner's communication was excellent.\nThere were a couple of drawbacks. The shower drain was extremely slow/backed up, which was a bit inconvenient. Additionally, there was a nearby apartment (upstairs?) with a dog that barked continuously throughout the day and early morning, making it challenging to sleep in (outside of the owner's control, but simply sharing).\nNonetheless, the positives outweighed the negatives, and I would absolutely stay here again!"", 'Great stay & great host! Super close to NYC!', 'Will stay again !', 'Things were great and it met our needs. A spacious apartment and comfortable furniture.', ""My family and I really enjoyed our stay at Maissel's place. It was a short drive to Times square which we enjoyed. He was very responsive and gave suggestions on restaurants/grocery stores in the area. I'd definitely stay here again."", ""Clean and quiet accommodation There is a bathtub but no shower. The warm water comes out well. The neighborhood security is bad. It's easy to get to New York."", ""We were looking for a place that could host three adults for a trip to Manhattan. This place popped up on Airbnb, and it turned out to be a great location for our trip. Self check-in was easy and we were able to check in without any issues after hours. Getting into the city is a breeze using public transit. The nearest bus stop is only a couple minutes walk away, and buses arrive every few minutes with the next stop being the bus terminal which is walking distance to Times Square and trains to everywhere else. We didn't spend much time in Union City, however, there are the necessities nearby: Dunkin Doughnuts, 24 hour grocery store and a Walgreens within walking distance and plenty of restaurant options, that can be uber'd to. I would recommend this place for visiting NYC."", 'For a family of four, this was a great landing spot/home base for getting in and out of NYC with ease. The communication was excellent and made the stay easy. The only downside is parking, only because it is on street and sometimes a block or two away, based on availability, but that is hardly the fault of the renter and the reality of the environment. The living space was immaculate, accessible, and efficient.', 'Loved staying here! Everything was just as it was pictured. Maissel was a responsive host and amazing communicator. She checked on me throughout my stay to make sure everything was great! Definitely will stay here again when in town!', 'A beautiful apartment for 5 people, super clean and well-equipped. Access to NYC is in 15 minutes, the bus is 100 meters away. I would recommend this rental to anyone who wants to explore the city.', 'We had an amazing holiday. The apartment was exactly as expected and the location was great. This is the perfect place to stay if you are looking for somewhere to easily go to New York every day. It really is only about 10mins on the bus to the Port Authority Bus Terminal. Brilliant views of Manhattan skyline are only a few mins walk away. Hoboken is worth a visit one evening.

I look forward to it.üëçüèª', ""This AirBnb was exactly how it was described and how the pictures looked. VERY nice place...like a small condo but enough space to lounge and have time away from others if need be, since there were two bedrooms plus the living room and dining room off the living room. Maissel communicated back and forth with me easily when I was booking the place and a few times during our stay when I had questions. There are convenient bus stops nearby, as well as a great mom & pop store one block away. We didn't discover it until the last day. Wished we would have sooner! We would definetely stay here again. Two side notes...if you're not used to city noise, bring ear plugs. You can hear quite a bit of noise at night, but once I put in my ear plugs, I slept well. Also, the kitchen has the bare essentials but could use more dish towels, some oven mitts, and mixing bowls. Overall, just a wonderful place!"", 'Very nice apartment. Tastefully decorated.

Erika is clearly thoughtful of this. From smell proof seals on the doors of the rooms next to the kitchen, to a holder for your hygiene products in the shower etc. I‚Äôve been in airbnbs where I smelt cooking from the kitchen in my room, or a shower where I had no where to put my stuff, so it‚Äôs appreciated when provided. The house is very clean and always smells fresh, they clean everyday, the trash will never get full. You don‚Äôt really have to ask for anything because it‚Äôs all provided, although for longer stays, I‚Äôve had to ask for a fresh towel, which was brought to me within seconds of asking so it‚Äôs not a problem. The mattress was a bit firm for my taste, but that‚Äôs just my personal preference, I know ppl who‚Äôll love the mattress, and despite my preference, I‚Äôve always got a good night sleep.

Located in the south Yonkers neighborhood, a little gloomy where you have to be careful and where we should not hang out too much at night [we returned no later than 10 p.m. without worries], this house contrasts with its cleanliness and care for the latter. Impeccable bathrooms and kitchen cleaned every night, available kitchen tools, flat plates, toaster, and even microwave. We are greeted by a room that could be featured in a branded hotel, impeccable tidy bed, cushion sheets, small table, wardrobe TV and even bath linen.

Mind the flight of stairs to get to the flat; no elevator. We stayed one week and would be happy to return.', 'Overall we had a good stay. Amit met us at check-in, helped carry our bags up, showed us the space, and gave some great local recommendations. The location was incredibly convenient for exploring the city, right by the park, restaurants, shops etc. The apartment was a good size - my wife and I stayed w our toddler and the apartment had a travel crib that was perfect, and being on the second story meant not too many steps to deal with.\nThere were a few small issues that surfaced during our stay (refrigerator happened to pick that week to die and the sink picked that week to spring a leak), but we really appreciated how incredibly responsive Amit was at responding to these issues. Problems can happen anytime, what‚Äôs more important is how the owner addresses them and Amit was truly excellent in this regard!!

The kitchen and dining space worked well for us, and the living room pull out bed was comfortable', 'What a fabulous apartment in a great location! You can easily get around NYC with close-by subway stops and buses. Central Park is a block away. If you‚Äôve already visited the main first-time visitor ‚Äúmust-see‚Äôs,‚Äù there is plenty to do and see on the Upper East Side. This is a quiet neighborhood, and the bedroom being away from the street is especially quiet, dark as well. With all that and the comfortable bed, you will sleep like a dream! The kitchen is small but well equipped. During the week we stayed, we ate almost all our breakfasts in and cooked several dinners and had everything we needed. There are many great restaurants within a short walk. Our favorite was Bustan‚Äôs on Amsterdam. There is a Trader Joe‚Äôs 7 short blocks away, and other closer grocery stores. There is air-con in the living room and bedroom so we were comfortable. Loved the HOT water as well as the great water pressure in the shower. Can‚Äôt wait for our next visit!', 'My husband and I stayed here for a week and were so happy with the place. It was in a beautiful brownstone and so charming. The bed was comfortable and the shower was great. Had a Kitchen you could actually use and good air-conditioning.\nThose are great points but don‚Äôt compare to the excellent location and convenience of this apartment. It is a short walk to the end of the block to Central Park and the street is very quiet.\nWe were delighted with the numerous restaurants nearby. Good restaurants too! We laughed when we decided to get a latte and google maps pointed to 2 spots within a one minute walk from us. If you want to cook at home there is a supermarket less that 5 minutes away. We loved that.\nLast but not least, communication was so good. We never had to wait long for any reply and appreciated the late evening meeting when we arrived at the apartment. Checkin and check-out was very easy. There is a single flight of stairs to get up to the apartment.\nFive stars all around. Thanks so much.', 'We loved the place and had a wonderful time. Great location, small but very convenient, terrific hosts - helpful, courteous, flexible and responsive. Highly recommended.', 'The place is conveniently located, with a comfortable mattress.\nAnd Gil was flexible when we asked for an early arrival.', 'We thoroughly enjoyed Gil‚Äôs place! It is quite large and comfortable, with uncluttered pleasant decor and lots of light. The bed gave us a good night‚Äôs sleep every night with plenty of room around it for dressing or working. Since we stayed two weeks, we also appreciated plenty of closet space and space in the bathroom medicine cabinet so we could really move in, as well as an extra closet for coats, back packs, etc. The kitchen is small, but well equipped, and a good grocery store is right around the corner. Of course there are so many nice places to eat within walking distance and the park and metro are 1 block away. We practically lived in the park!', 'Great location, one block from Central Park and a subway station. Great upper west side neighborhood close to tons of restaurants. Cozy clean apartment with everything you could possibly need. Gil couldn‚Äôt stop the rain but I‚Äôm not going to hold it against him.

Amit met us on arrival and was very hospitable and available for questions and help through out our stay. The apartment was clean and well stocked with cutlery and cooking appliances which was helpful for preparing quick meals for our young kids. The only one small negative for those sensitive to light in the early mornings was the blinds in the living room (which we used a second bedroom with the sofa bed) are quite sheer and therefore it gets light very early in the morning. The bedroom is spacious however with good block out blinds. Overall we had a great stay and would recommend this apartment to others. Thank you Gil and Amit', 'Gil is great. He is quick to respond to questions and very accommodating. Would recommend for sure!', 'Gil‚Äôs apartment was perfect for our NYC stay with our grandson. It is spacious and comfortable, with a roomy main bedroom and plenty of room in the living/dining area, as well as a well equipped and supplied kitchen. The living room sofa makes into a large bed for one or two, still leaving room to move around the space. The apartment is on the 2nd floor, with 17 steps up from the entrance, so if mobility is a challenge, this place might not work, but otherwise it has much to recommend it.\nWe loved the location on the upper West Side, just 1 block East to the subway on Central Park West and 2 blocks West to the subway on Broadway. Between them you can get anywhere in the city you want to go. There are many restaurants within a block or two and a big market just across Columbus St.\nThe apartment and neighborhood felt very safe, and outside noise was never a problem.', 'Good location. Spacious apartment. Would highly recommend.', 'Just perfect.

I was met personally when arriving - thank you Amit - and Amit was always available if we had any questions not only about the flat but about new York too. We would certainly book again.', 'You can‚Äôt really understate the value of the location. A block from the park, close to public transit, easy to get a car downtown. There is a big market on Sundays down the road so We ate in some with fresh ingredients we bought and the kitchen is well stocked to cook anything. Comfy bed and the bedroom is bigger than I expected. My 2 kids slept on their air beds in the bedroom next to the bed.

I give this apartment high marks--would definitely stay there again!', 'Of the three Airbnb places that I have rented, this by far was the best.

Best place ever.', 'Wonderful corner of Upper West side, close to everything you can think of! Surprisingly quiet and very well appointed.', 'This was our third time staying at Gil\'s apartment on West 85th Avenue in Manhattan and it was as delightful as were our past visits. The reader is encouraged to read our past two reviews concerning the apartment to learn about the amenities of the neighborhood but a block from Central Park and within a short walking distance from the museums, entertainment venues, great restaurants and interesting shopping districts. Our visit to the Big Apple to spend Thanksgiving with our infant grandson and family living but a few blocks away was greatly enhanced by having our own private digs so close at which to rest from babysitting duties in the evenings. In addition to the local attractions, we took long walks throughout the City to see additional sites (the Trade Center Memorial, the Highline elevated garden walk, Little Island Park, etc., that we had missed during previous visits to N.Y., as well as to other burrows of the great City, Harlem, Hell\'s Kitchen, Greenwich Village, Midtown, etc. All in all, a wonderful time; made particularly enjoyable by having such a comfortable a ""Home away from Home"" at our disposal.

Equipped with more than enough to stay in and cook. But you probably won't want to since fine restaurants are right around the corner. Central Park is a block away, the neighborhood is cozy, the AC units work well and the place was remarkably quiet. We would stay again!"", 'Having stayed at a good number of different Airbnb rentals over the past several years visiting our daughter twice yearly on New York‚Äôs Westside, we would judge Gil‚Äôs place as one the best in terms of cleanliness, comfort and convenience. The one floor walk-up is located but a block from Central Park and an easy walk to the Delacorte Theater (Shakespeare in the Park), the American Museum of Natural History, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Lincoln Center (New York City Ballet), etc., not to mention great local dinning (Vin Sur Vingt ‚Äì French wine and cuisine; Noi Due Caf√© ‚Äì Kosher Italian; Jacob‚Äôs Pickles ‚Äì Southern + beer; Sushi Nonaka ‚Äì Omasake; etc., ec.) and lots of high end shopping. As advertised, the apartment is spacious (for Manhattan), bright and a sanctuary of peace nestled in the bosom of an energized city. Everything is convenient, the kitchen well appointed and perfect for preparation of a home cooked meal. Everything had been thought of to make our stay pleasant and as comfortable as being at home. But the best point was the hospitality of our host, Gil; he patiently talked us through operation of the extensive entertainment system and even sent his manager on a Sunday evening (Rudy, who was both charming and efficient) to fix a blown light switch and otherwise promptly attended to our every need at the mere placement of a telephone call ‚Äì he made our stay so pleasant that we have already reserved the place for our next planned visit to the Big Apple in November. In a word: OUTSTANDING!!', 'Great location - comfortable apartment in a brownstone walk-up, excellent for two persons. The apartment is right on the corner of Columbus Ave, with markets, coffee shop and laundry/dry cleaner nearby. It has a practical kitchen and the living room has abundant light. The building was sufficiently quiet and the queen size bed comfortable (although the apartment floor slightly tilts causing us to roll over to the left side of the bed‚Ä¶). Only attention point was the Soviet-style building heating that was blazing in the bedroom despite outside temperature of 70 degrees. With some engineering effort, we managed to turn it off.', 'Gil‚Äôs place is located in the busy and fun Upper West Side with every amenity possible is within walking distance. I appreciated the buildings clean hallways, and easy walk up to the second floor.', 'Lovely stay at Gil‚Äôs place. Very quiet apartment, few minutes from Central Park.

At the same time, both the street and the apartment were quiet, which was very relaxing to come back to at the end of the day. The apartment was very clean, beds were comfortable, and the WiFi was strong enough for both work and streaming tv/movies. We really appreciated the air conditioners on the hot and humid days. And we cooked some basic meals in the kitchen easily. Overall, it worked perfectly for our needs. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll stay in a NY hotel again, if we have the chance to stay at Gil‚Äôs.', 'Great location and furnishings.', ""Gil's place was awesome the water filter in the fridge was a nice touch, shower water pressure was great. All the shampoos, body wash, toilet paper and cleaning products, fully stocked.\nPOSITION, POSITION,POSITION !! A really cute place with so much to offer in a safe neighborhood. Only a 3 min walk to Central Park & reservoir running track, 5 min walk to subway station on either line. Convenience store 3 min walk and Viand restaurant down steps & 1 door away for brekky, lunch or dinner, where one serve can feed 3, not to mention so many other great restaurant choices from all different cuisines. You don't need taxis here !! just the subway and a good pair of runners. Its walking distance to museums and even across a few blocks to the Hudson river. We walked everywhere except for when we had our suitcases. It was so much better than any hotel space was small but with separate living, bathroom & bedroom (the Bed was so comfortable).\nThe Modular lounge with the pull out foot rest / additional bed was great too. We were very comfortable here. Although we didn't get to meet Gil, we were greeted by his associate Amit who couldn't have been a better help. He was so engaged and willing to help us at any point of call. We will definitely return if ever in New York again. Thankyou."", ""I had the pleasure of staying in Gil's home for two weeks, while I visited my daughter at Columbia University. His location has a convenient subway line to her school, but I often found myself walking the easy 40 minutes each way. The minute you step outside the building you are in a hot-spot of fantastic restaurants and businesses. It is an extremely safe neighborhood filled with strollers, and lots of people walking dogs. Everything you need is right there!\nI stayed for two weeks and got to know the neighbor across the hall that has lived there since the 1970's. She was lovely, as well as everyone else in the building. I was able to order something online from Amazon, and it was left at the entrance with all the other packages. I felt like a real local. ;)\nMy stay was during July, when temperatures reached the 100's for several days. The humidity was staggering. I'm a long time Northern California resident and worried that the window units would not be enough to keep me comfortable. I was wrong. Both units worked great, and cooled off the apartment beautifully.\nThe house is completely stocked, with generous bedding, cleaning supplies, and enough kitchen necessities to cook most any meal.\nI highly recommend this place!"", 'Gil was communicative, friendly, and helpful.

We loved the neighbourhood and Victoria's place was a perfect, stylish oasis to return to. Air conditioned was excellent and much needed. Victoria was very welcoming."", 'This apartment is great if you want that bohemian feel. It‚Äôs spacious with a separate living room area that can be closed off if you want. I did hear some yelling in the hallway one night, but Victoria was quickie to assure me it was just her friend. There are 2 mini split AC‚Äôs, which kept it nice & cool. Great shower, mini fridge & Keurig in the room. I wouldn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd want to go down the steep staircase to cook, just eat out. My only issue was there was a lot of dust & grit around the bed frame‚Ä¶.but I‚Äôm a neat freak,', 'If you love the west village, this is a great location just one block off of Hudson St with all its eateries. The bedroom is in the back, which allowed us to sleep peacefully. My husband and I were visiting for our 11 year anniversary - the first trip without our daughter in 7 years - so we were ecstatic to get away to a comfortable place. I‚Äôve been renting places on Airbnb for over 10 years and have hosted myself for two different properties, and believe I can offer a fair assessment.\nPros: the owner let us check in early (so appreciated); owner is friendly and greets you upon arrival (could also be a con for introverts); comfortable queen bed and linens; spacious for NYC standards; not on a very busy street. Very clean; shampoos and body wash provided (so nice to not have to pack this);\nVery interesting art work and sculpture throughout the space gave it personality and we enjoyed this aspect.\nDrawbacks: beautiful outdoor backyard space not regularly accessible to renters (untapped potential here); shared kitchen (though ‚Äúshared,‚Äù does not feel open to you as there is a tenant on first floor); lack of privacy - we could easily hear conversations in the hallway (3 floors) so we realized that we could also be heard, especially since there are 3 doors exiting from the suite to the hallway. Due to the shared kitchen situation and a sense that it would be awkward to be there, we were grateful for the mini-fridge and microwave provided in the suite. We didn‚Äôt tackle the espresso machine (no instructions) and would have appreciated a simple coffee maker instead.\nSide note: My experience of a ‚ÄúSuperhost‚Äù has changed over the recent years. It used to just be responsive communication and a clean, well thought out comfortable space. Today‚Äôs superhost demonstrates exemplary hosting -‚Äògoing above and beyond. For example, our last host in New Mexico left a welcome basket with a bottle of wine, homemade dog treats from a local bakery (we had our dogs with us), and fresh baked cookies (and it wasn‚Äôt even our anniversary!). She communicated ahead of time to see if we had any allergies before leaving these treats. Labels for light switches and remotes were there so we didn‚Äôt have to speculate or require the host to explain in person. None of this was expected, but so appreciated. That is the new ‚Äúsuperhost.‚Äù\nVictoria‚Äôa hosting is more yesteryear - good enough (which is very good), but not exemplary.', ""A superb and artsy location in the west Village, especially if you're planning to dine out on most occasions (there is a shared kitchen, but it's on a different floor--the apartment itself has a microwave, mini-fridge, and Nespresso machine). Communication with Victoria was always quick and easy, and if you're new to the city she's happy to give recommendations about what to do and how to get about."", 'Oh, where do I begin?! We absolutely loved the vibe of Victoria‚Äôs place‚Ä¶.. so artistically decorated and details throughout to make her guests comfortable. Walk to yummies in minutes. Location, perfect. Beautiful sunlight through the trees in the morning, yes trees. Peaceful block‚Ä¶ thank you Victoria!!!', ""My friend and I stayed for a week at Victoria's wonderful apartment - it was just perfect for our first trip to New York - By far the best AirBnB experience I've ever had!\nVictoria was prompt to respond to all of our queries before, and during the trip - including emergency dental recommendations!! She was the best first New Yorker interaction we could have asked for, and took care to introduce us to the apartment and the local area. She allowed us to drop our bags off early and pick them up later to check in/out which was a huge help. Victoria is generally just a gem and well deserving of her Superhost title.\nThe apartment was super clean and had everything we needed - the Nespresso machine was a very welcome touch! It is well decorated with original features, gorgeous art and sculpture and we loved that the building and artwork had a family history. The area is quieter at night than we expected but close enough to everything lively that we were looking for in the evenings, so we were always well rested in the comfy beds.\nThe location is absolutely perfect! Easy to walk to various districts, restaurants and bars are just a block over, you're close to the river and the High Line, and you really feel like you're in the middle of it all.\nCouldn't have asked for anything more really and absolutely can't fault it.

The subway was about an 8-10 minute walk that felt like half that, because the scenery was so nice. We had an easy time getting to all the various places we wanted to go. Victoria was friendly, responsive, and happy to share the vey interesting history of her 1800s building. The best parts about the rooms: high ceilings, beautiful sculptures and paintings, original moldings, natural light from tall windows, clean linens, plush towels, comfortable pillows. The only knocks: the semi-opaque window shades let in a fair amount of night light from surrounding buildings, there was a strong smell of Marijuana one night, and there is a narrow flight of stairs to navigate with luggage that could be difficult for some. Overall we loved our stay, and it will be our first choice if we return.', 'Stylish apartment in a hip area of Manhattan. Victoria was fantastic, we would happily return!', ""My daughter and I travelled to NYC to celebrate her birthday and we spent a wonderful time at Victoria's home.

We did a tour of the neighbourhood which enabled me to appreciate The Village even more. If you have time, catch a show at the Cherry Lane Theatre.

I would have appreciated a heads up that she was sick and the option to book another place. Five days later I am now coughing. My guess is that she didn't do a good job cleaning the space given her health. The bathroom and floors were dirty. The bedding was definitely far below par. The duvet did not have a cover on it, the sheets were old and dingy and the pillows were old and uncomfortable. The residents of the townhouse could be heard throughout my stay although it was not excessive and didn't bother me too much. I didn't make any requests since the host was sick and I didn't want to be around her. Overall it was a disappointing stay however I loved the west village and will definitely stay there again next time I am in the city."", 'Book it!

Room 5 was HUGE and comfortable. It was low to mid-90s while I was there and humid. It was so nice to come home at the end of the day and relax in that room with its great air conditioning. The bathroom was great and that shower was amazing. It was a nice residential neighborhood with restaurants and stores within walking distance. The only drawback was I had trouble navigating the stairs in the house. This isn't really anything negative about the house. But if you have mobility issues like I do (knee and foot injuries) just keep in mind you do have to go up to the third floor. The host was very open and welcoming. I would definitely recommend this, especially for women traveling alone. I felt very safe there."", ""I highly recommend this AirBnB!

Enjoyed my stay!', ""Don't hesitate - book it now! 11/10 place to stay.\nAn amazing studio packed with every amenity you'd need for a short stint in the city. I found it the perfect place to kick off my week in NYC as a solo traveller, and S&G were fantastic hosts and were kind enough to offer a flexible / late check-out to align with my later departure time. The apartment is exactly as described and pictured - a fourth floor walk-up, very compact etc. - but it's been so well thought out that I didn't find any of these elements posed a downside (even lugging my bag up the three flights of stairs - what a good workout!).\nAlso located in a very convenient spot in the East Village, within 10 mins walk to the Q/R/N, 4/5/6, L (and probably a few others I forgot) but very walkable if you'd prefer to skip the subway and just get around on foot."", 'Loved my stay! Every detail of the studio was intentionally crafted from the cozy bed and linens, to the various types of towels, to the variety of hangers to use, to the under bed storage, the free snacks and milk options to accompany the nesspresso machine. The street can be a little lively but the host provided the most comfortable earbuds for nighttime sleeping so it really didn‚Äôt affect my sleep at all. I loved having the window open and feeling the fresh April breeze, and the various doors to get in and out of the studio helped me to feel safe and secure even when traveling alone in a big city.

I will def be back again and look forward to another stay.', 'S&G‚Äôs place is well designed, very clean and has lovely amenities and complimentary snacks.

Thank you again Shala and Guillermo üôè', ""S&G's place was the absolute perfect place for a solo traveller to lay their head. I realised the exact building had been on my vision board for years and it really lived up to my manifestations :D. It was clean and pristine, with surprisingly enough room for your clothes and items to be tucked away and not feel cluttered even for a week long stay. It felt really safe, yet at the same time was in the middle of everything you needed. 5 mins from Thompsons Sq Park and Thompsons Sq Bagels. It was only a 7-minute walk to Astor subway.
