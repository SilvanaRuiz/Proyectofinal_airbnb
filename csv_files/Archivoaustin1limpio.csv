The kitchen was stocked well above average in both kitchen equipment as well as spices and some condiments in the frig. She also left some bottle water and coffee to get us started. The bath had a number of common toiletry items you might keep at home but, not expect to see in a rental.

Our kids were even able to ride their scooters to breakfast two mornings and really enjoyed that. The home is not large, but it worked perfectly for the 4 of us. Only having one bathroom worked because of the built it storage next to the sink.

Overall we really liked the house and neighborhood and would come back one day. Only drawback would be that since the house is old it‚Äôs less insulated so we felt like we had to be quiet when the baby was asleep and turn the tv down etc. But that wouldn‚Äôt keep us from coming back.

While we did not feel it was as private and comfortable as it would have been if they also did not live there, we never saw them and our privacy was respected.

If you are sensitive to light, i would recommend an eye mask because the curtains let though a good amount of light.

Everything was perfect for making our 5 day stay cozy and relaxing."", 'The bungalow was absolutely dreamy. Every piece of art & decor was beautifully placed. I instantly fell in love with the reclaimed wood üòç The temperpedic bed was so comfortable. The place came equipped with everything we needed, from a steamer to even insect repellent. Loved that the kitchen had a toaster oven and Brita.\nNow‚Äî some things to note. If you have a rolling luggage, expect a little difficulty when wheeling it through their backyard since it‚Äôs mainly gravel ground. Additionally, the spiral staircase is NARROW. Even for a smaller person like me, it was somewhat hard to climb up/down the stairs, especially with our luggages. Lastly, the loft area is small space & only suitable for a child.\nDuring the trip, Patrice gave us a heads up of thunderstorms in the area. Truly showed how caring she is. Luckily, we were able to catch Patrice on our way out, and she was the absolute sweetest.\nTreehouse bungalow is a 10/10.

It was great having plenty of places within walking distance :)', 'We booked Patrice and Daniel‚Äôs place without much context for the geography of Austin. The value was outstanding. I was surprised at how quiet and quaint the neighborhood felt as we turned off the main road. We rented a car and we‚Äôre there for the ACL Festival. Likely an Uber would have been about the same as renting a car for 2 days to get back and forth from downtown, but the car gave us more flexibility. Good coffee shops and bakery within walking distance (we‚Äôre from Boston, for us that means within 1.25miles.

If you have a normal amount of luggage though, you will have no problem!', 'We really enjoyed our stay with Patrice and Daniel.

We opted for a suburban feel vs. downtown and were very satisfied with our choice; the neighborhood is very quiet and there are great and interesting dining and shopping options nearby. The room itself worked well with a large, comfortable bed for me and a cute upstairs loft for my daughter. We both slept very well. Although there is no dishwasher or kitchen sink the hosts provide a bin for dirty plates, etc. and they take care of them as needed.

This was a great place for us as we stayed busy during the day and just needed a place to sleep and shower. Weston and Elizabeth were great hosts. The garden is beautiful. Street parking can be a little tricky in this area. Our only ‚Äúcomplaint‚Äù is the bed, and it may be more about personal preference and may not be an issue for a single sleeper. We found the bed to be too soft for us and often resulted in us rolling towards the middle of the mattress, which didn‚Äôt make for great nights of sleep (lots of tossing and turning). If I was lying in the bed alone, I didn‚Äôt notice it as much and if you like a soft mattress, this one fits the bill.

It seems like pretty much everything is a simple 10-20 min drive in Austin so the location was fine for us and we are usually used to being right in the mix. I‚Äôm glad we were a little north.\nOne thing to consider. If you are looking for a place to just hang out and not leave this probably isn‚Äôt for you. It‚Äôs everything you need nothing you don‚Äôt, but also nothing extra. There is a tv, but you can‚Äôt see it from bed if you plan on just lounging.

Weston and Elizabeth are super hosts, quick to respond, and available if we need anything, but they also keep a low profile to give us privacy.

There was a folding desk under the bed that was just what I needed for my laptop, since I did need to do some work that week. Weston provided a nice office chair. The bathroom and shower were fine and supplied with plenty of fluffy towels.

There are some small kitchen appliances, microwave, rice cooker, toaster, nutrabullet, and an electric kettle, but they are no longer offering a hot plate.

Also, the towels felt very used, and were tiny, which is always a little frustrating, but no different than what you'd get at any standard lower end hotel.\nAlso, the bed felt VERY unstable.

I will certainly consider this tiny home for my next visit to Austin!', 'This tiny home was everything as described & more! Sam was an excellent host who thought of every detail. Other than saying hi upon check in, we didn‚Äôt see him. It was like we weren‚Äôt on his property! The home is equipped with smart technology. It is clean, modern and cozy. You don‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre in a tiny home when you are here. There‚Äôs a lot of space to move around. While you can‚Äôt stand in the loft, there‚Äôs enough room to sit up and get in and out of bed. Bed and pillows were comfortable and we slept well. All basic essentials were provided. There‚Äôs a cute sitting area outside the tiny home and the hot tub was nice to take soak in at night. What makes this place even more special is that Sam built it himself.\nMy fianc√© and I genuinely enjoyed our stay.\nIt‚Äôs a short 15 minute Uber ride to the city or 25 minute electric scooter ride. Sam had ample recommendations in a binder when we arrived. We did the tubing river tour and Barton springs per Sam‚Äôs recommendation, and it was truly a blast. I cannot rave enough about this place. We will definitely be back, and we also truly recommend staying here if you are in Austin.', 'Very comfortable bed. Right across the street from a great running trail. Close to great food trucks.', 'Awesome stay in Austin! Very cool tiny home in a very cool part of town. Sam was a great host and we loved all his recommendations in the guest book.', 'Went for Valentine‚Äôs it was so fun and cute!! Loved it and made me want a tiny home!! Host responded Asap when I texted. Would definitely recommend.', 'Nice place to stay for a couple days! Clean and cozy! The bed was so comfortable (just be careful not bumping your head on the way up to the bed!). Jacuzzi was nice as well as the over head string lights. Recommend staying here!', ""The AirBnB was clean and as expected. If you're tall might want to be careful on the loft because the ceiling is low."", 'Absolutely fantastic stay at Maria‚Äôs tiny home. Beautiful, peaceful neighborhood close to some of the hippest spots in Austin. Easy parking, beautiful and well-equipped space and the hot tub was a definite plus! Would absolutely recommend. Had a great experience!', 'Samuels place was perfectly located! I visited a new restaurant or bar each night I was there and never drove more that 15 minutes.', 'this tiny home is so cute and efficient! stayed at sam‚Äôs tiny house for three days while here for some concerts! super easy check in and check out with very detailed and easy instructions. never had any issues with privacy! sam is very respectful, helpful, and polite throughout the stay! sam also responds quickly, in case of any questions or concerns. this home had everything we couldve possibly needed and didn‚Äôt think to bring: scissors, kitchen utensils (toaster+blender was a plus), hangers, steamer! don‚Äôt forget about the Alexa and automatic blinds! comfy bed and couch! sam has a pdf that includes everything you need to know about the home as well as Austin‚Äôs hot spots! overall, loved every single bit of our stay! great host! will definitely be back!', 'Good location, right by a great park. The space is good for maybe a two day stay but nothing over that. Not a lot of privacy since people were often in the yard doing yard work or in the hot tub and the dog is aggressive (cute, but will sprint right up to you at full speed and not stop barking). The unit also has a weird mildew smell to it and water gets into the bathroom floor from the shower. Not for tall people but I think that is pretty clear in the listing.', 'Jake‚Äôs (tiny) home was such a phenomenal stay for the formula 1 race! So close to downtown, but far enough to stay away from the over-population. Jacuzzi was comfy, the bed and furniture was nice. And last but not least, their dog was so cute. Thanks for everything Jake!', 'nice little house in a great area. only thing i would say is that of you are 6 feet or taller the upstairs bed area is going to be a little tight', 'Great little spot on the outskirts on the East Side of Austin! Highly recommend. Very clean with friendly & responsive hosts.', 'A great place to stay, was an easy checkin, with all the amenities you would require. It is also close to downtown Austin. Samuel is a great host, easily reachable and provided us with details to do an easy checkin and answered our queries. He also left us some recommendation which were great!. I would surely stay in this place when I am back in Austin again and would recommend the same for others', 'Great space. Great communication with host. Highly recommended!', 'Sam and his partner arguably have one of the most adorable tiny homes on AirBnB. They are very friendly, very communicative, and very up to date on what‚Äôs new in Austin! They gave us several great recommendations in their welcome binder. This is home is mostly all operated by smart technology, which we loved. The hot tub is clean and never had a scheduling issue with Sam on using that at all, as he does use his own hot tub. It was perfect for a girls weekend, the location is easily accessible to the interstate. We were about a 12 min drive from 6th street, 20 min drive to The Domain for shopping. The only negative is the bed is open on the top, meaning there is no railing up there so BE CAREFUL. It‚Äôs high enough that you could break a bone if you fell. We mentioned this to Sam and he did say he has all the things for railing, he just needs the time. So I‚Äôm sure that will be tended to soon! We loved our stay. If I‚Äôm ever back in Austin, I will def check to see if they have availability!', 'Me and my wife loved the tiny home experience. It‚Äôs extremely clean and the details put into the home makes it very worth it. Sam always communicated with us through the whole stay.', 'Fantastic place to stay!

Will definitely be booking again!', ""Great little place that's within 15 minutes of downtown."", 'One of the best airbnbs I‚Äôve been to! Only complaint could be the bed roof is kinda low so I hit my head once or twice haha but the bed itself is probably the best I‚Äôve ever felt at an airbnb.', ""What a perfect Austin getaway! We had some tickets for ACL Live and needed an equally fun stay. This tiny home stay was exactly what I was looking for! It comes with a full kitchen (tiny-home sized) and a full bathroom with shower. Highly recommend and we'll stay again!"", 'My husband and I spent a long weekend in Austin celebrating our anniversary and Samuel‚Äôs tiny house was the perfect place for us to stay! Cute, cozy and well stocked with all the little things to make you feel comfortable! The hot tub is a nice bonus too :)', 'Tiny house was so beautiful and inspiring. Great location in Austin, lots to do and the town felt safe. The airbnb was comfortable & warm in cold January temps. Had every appliance you might need.

We loved staying here while visiting Austin, hope to come again!!!', 'Great little spot for a couple or 2 or 3 friends. My boyfriend and I loved it, location has a lot to offer and downtown was just a short drive away. Host was super hospitable and accommodating, overall great experience trying a tiny home! :)', 'We stayed in Samuel‚Äôs tiny house while spending a long weekend in Austin for our wedding anniversary. It was the perfect size for the two of us and was very clean, modern and comfortable while being stocked with everything that we might need. The location was great as it is close to so many restaurants and coffee shops in East Austin. It was also very close to downtown, Lady Bird Lake and the South Congress area. We had a wonderful time and will definitely be back the next time we are in Austin.', 'This was one of the best AirBnb experiences I‚Äôve ever had. Not only was the tiny house beautiful, but the shared backyard area was an oasis. Sam was extremely responsive, friendly, easy to talk to, and welcoming. He was flexible with my checkout time on the last day (note: there was no one else checking in immediately after me, allowing this to be possible) and I am very grateful. One of my favorite unexpected touches was that the pillows on the bed weren‚Äôt all the same - I find that at most hotels or Airbnb‚Äôs they usually are and it can be hard to get comfy if they‚Äôre not your preferred pillow type! It‚Äôs the little things in life :) thanks, Sam, for an incredible stay! And people, if you‚Äôre debating whether to stay here, DO IT!', 'Fantastic tiny home enough for me and my girlfriend. I am 6‚Äô3 so the loft area was a little tight, but still comfortable', 'Amazing stay and great host. Nice and clean place. What especially stood out was all of the recommendations on things to do in Austin!', 'Samuel was extremely helpful and responsive when it came to any questions we had about the home. He also includes a binder filled with excellent recommendations for dining, nights on the town, things to do in the area, and more. We had an amazing time thanks to our stay at this adorable tiny home!', 'Samuel was friendly and the tiny house was great - just as described or better!', 'This is a very nice, quiet home to get away and relax! It‚Äôs very secluded, but still only a very short 10-15 min drive to most things near and around the downtown area. It gets warm in Austin in the summer, but the home has a remote controlled AC unit, ceiling fan, and portable fan tucked under the bed that keep the climate of the home very comfortable. And if you are a dog lover, there is a very friendly dog who is on property that loves to greet new guests!', 'Sam provided great recommendations for the Austin area. We took up on some of his recommendations and every place was amazing. The tiny home if very beautiful and cozy! Definitely would recommend this Airbnb!\nOnly complaint we had would be the pet hair that clung to our clothes and socks; even though it was no pets allowed.', 'Fun place especially the location. We went there for the GP and it was perfect. So much to do in that area of Austin.', 'Maria‚Äôs place was great, very clean, nice amenities, kitchen full if you‚Äôre planning to cook, good location, great communication.\nI only have one note. I stayed when it was very cold (around 15F) and there‚Äôs only a single hvac unit that is not enough for the whole place, the ceiling is quite high, which can be nice, but in this case it meant the heat stayed towards the ceiling. The good thing is that the bed in the second floor was quite warm and comfortable always, but downstairs was freezing. I would recommend plug in heaters for the kitchen/living room area. Other than that, great place. Would stay again.', 'Great stay, very fun home. This was our first tiny home so we were happy!', 'A couple of concerns were dealt with professionally', 'Loved loved loved this tiny home! Super spacious, with lovely fittings and was squeaky clean with everything we needed except a can opener (which Samuel kindly lent us). Samuel was extremely responsive and made us feel very welcome. A perfect trip and would definitely stay again!', 'The tiny home was perfect: comfortable, clean, and well equipped. The hot tub was a nice bonus! Everything was easy (check-in, parking, communication, check-out, etc. were all a breeze) The backyard space was shared, but the home itself felt quite private. We had a great stay!!', 'Good bang for your buck.', 'Cute place with everything we needed. The trail and park access is great - across the street. Very quiet at night. Comfy bed.', 'Wonderful stay! Such a beautiful tiny home with very thoughtful accommodations. I will definitely stay here again! Thank you for being such a wonderful host.', 'I‚Äôll start with saying this was my first ‚Äútiny home‚Äù experience, and it did not disappoint. It was a pleasant experience put simply, and had everything we needed! Sam is a great host, and had a long list of suggestions and his personal fave‚Äôs. He was very accommodating and let us check in early, which was helpful because we had flown in so early. Easy to communicate with, and always quick to reply. Even though the tiny home was located in his backyard, there‚Äôs enough space between the main house and tiny home that still allows for privacy. The hot tub was a huge perk as well. Overall awesome experience, and I would definitely recommend to friends and fellow travelers.', ""Sam's tiny house is awesome! It's actually quite spacious and feels very clean and homey :)\nI had a fantastic stay!"", 'Comfortable tiny home, with a beautiful yard and large hot tub. Sam is a friendly and gracious host, and will make your stay very warm. Any issues that came up were dealt with immediately. The location was close to downtown, and parking was ideal.', 'Sam was super friendly, flexible and responsive.\nThe tiny home is as great as the pictures.\nFor a single woman traveling to a new town this place felt so safe.', ""Samuel's tiny home was great! It's right next to a greenway so it was super easy to make our way into town on bikes that we rented from a local bike shop. Much more cost effective than Uber and Lyft, and also saved us so much waiting time, plus it made it easier for us to eat and drink more due to biking around! The tiny home was just as pictured, nothing about it felt cramped, and it has a full size fridge, bathroom, and an oven so you can cook if you want. The yard came complete with Quinn, Samuel's cute little dog, and we vibed in the warm weather in the grassy yard in the mornings. Dipped in the jacuzzi one night one and it was very nice. I couldn't get the tv to work on our last night there, though I didn't try very hard because I was pretty zonked by the end of our trip. 10 outta 10 would recommend, Thanks Sam!"", 'Awesome time in Austin! This tiny home really made me feel like being at home! Walkable and close areas around! Hot tub was the cherry on top‚ò∫Ô∏è! Would totally stay again!!', 'Great stay , very private, great host. Beautiful getaway ! Felt very peaceful. You will be in the mist of beautiful and peaceful nature and you‚Äôll wake up to a beautiful view in the house with the sunshine.

I didn‚Äôt get a change to use the hot tub but the set up was amazing. Also, Sam was super nice and communicative.', 'The tiny house is amazing\nI enjoyed staying there.

Thanks again!', 'Great cozy Tiny Hone in East Austin! Maria was very responsive and attentive', 'Sam‚Äôs tiny home exceeded my expectations and was nothing short of superb. The home was clean and is probably the cleanest home I‚Äôve stayed at. The location is super close to Downtown Austin. I chose Uber as my mode of transportation as I was staying out late at night and it was a convenient and affordable location. There‚Äôs a trail in front of the home which I regret not using more. Finally, Sam was a great host. We crossed paths a few time and he was sure to give me privacy and offer recommendations. He recommended I have dinner at Emmer and Rye and it was delicious. Look forward to staying here again.', 'The location was perfect, the room was clean but when u are on vacation and u see ur bed is located where the ceiling is touching ur head then you don‚Äôt wanna ruin ur trip like that. It was uncomfortable and annoying that u have to use the ladder which is not at all safe to go up and u have to stay down in order to reach the bed, and when u wake up u gotta keep in mind that u gonna hit the ceiling if u don‚Äôt pay attention where you are. People who weigh‚Äôs more than 200 lb and ppl taller than 5 ft., should not book this airbnb at all.\nNo offense but it can be remodeled in a way where the bed can be in an appropriate location.\nThanks', 'Adorable, clean tiny home in a quiet neighborhood.

Just a quick 10 min drive takes you down to the center of the mayhem in Austin yet some of the best restaurants in town are even closer. The casita itself is the perfect size for 1-2 people and feels bigger than it is once you‚Äôre inside. Bright, airy, and clean in all the ways. I‚Äôll stay again and again if she‚Äôll have me.

Perfect for two people and in a very cute, historic neighborhood with some unique homes. We appreciated having some food options within walking distance, and we loved Pease Park.\nTwo things to keep in mind: there is no outdoor seating, though there is a patio. Also, with respect to the location, it‚Äôs a bit tough to leave the neighborhood on foot (due to highways and streets that are not pedestrian-friendly). You can walk downtown, but it is quite far.

Highly recommend and would return in a heartbeat!', 'This is a cheerful and pleasant place to stay in Austin. Reviews from other guests who noted it is ""cozy"" and ""cute"" are exactly right and the Clarksville neighborhood has a lot of charm. There are also a grocery store and a handful of restaurants on nearby Lynn Street. But if you are in Austin without a car getting to the UT Campus or the south side or, even, downtown from this location is definitely not easy. The bus stop for the bus to/from the airport is nearly a mile and half away and there are also no nearby CapMetro bike share stations.', 'Monica‚Äôs place is in a beautiful neighborhood, (definitely just wander around while you‚Äôre here!) exactly as expected if not even nicer and the communication was top notch. Best I‚Äôve experienced with Airbnb and she‚Äôs put labels throughout the place to make everything easy to navigate and it allows you to not feel like your bothering her with a bunch of questions which I appreciate. The bed was super comfortable and there were different pillow type options to use (I have both low back and neck problems if that helps). Its close to downtown if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for but if you go out east while you‚Äôre downtown it‚Äôs a bit far, you‚Äôll probably want to get a ride back. They weren‚Äôt too expensive though.\nBring earplugs if you plan on sleeping past 9am on weekdays, it seems like that‚Äôs when the construction going on near the house starts. I wake up early and always travel with them anyways so I was totally fine.

There was a slight delay getting the water to heat but the hosts were extremely responsive and had the issue addressed immediately. If you‚Äôre only staying a night or two and want to use the hot tub I‚Äôd recommend asking that they go ahead and heat it before you arrive as it will take a couple hours otherwise (it was in the 60‚Äôs before the heater got turned on)‚Äîmake sure you see the little fire icon in the app to be sure it‚Äôs actively heating the hot tub. It seemed to alternate heating the hot tub and the pool but not simultaneously so just make sure you‚Äôre heating the one you want. We walked down to S Lamar multiple times and there are a number of awesome restaurants (Uchi, Loro) and coffee shops (Merit, Proud Mary) nearby.', 'Our stay at Keith and Shannon‚Äôs casita was amazing! They were awesome, the best hosts we have ever worked with. Elena forgot to pack her toothbrush but our hosts picked up a toothbrush for us!!

On our departure day, we had a flat tire which Keith lended a hand by inflating it with his equipment. Really can‚Äôt say enough about our hosts - simply amazing!

I feel so lucky to have spent a week here. High in the trees, it's lovely to have an aerial view. The A-frame and high ceilings make the space feel so spacious. Although it's not huge, it doesn't feel cramped, it's set up beautifully with the bed feeling like a cozy nook, space for a couch and dining table, and a great little kitchen. The bathroom is airy as well with nice light and a washer and dryer--incredible! Ashton and Charm could not have been more warm and welcoming. A chair broke while I was there and I felt so sorry and instead they apologized and wanted to give me a gift certificate to a local eatery--so kind. I didn't feel the need to take them up on it--things happen!--but just the level of kindness and hospitality-- next level. They were always in touch and responsive and although I didn't meet either one of them, I felt their support and kindness. It was a lovely stay."", 'This place was perfect!

I could not be happier with the choice to stay here and 100% would do so again. Ashton was a fantastic host!!', 'We used Ashton‚Äôs place as a base camp for exploring Austin for the first time. In short, it really doesn‚Äôt get any better than this. First off: location. A very short walk to S Congress, you step out your door and within minutes you are in the thick of an incredibly vibrant district. There are great places to eat, drink, and take in live music within blocks, and we were close enough to walk to downtown and to ACL at the Moody. Second off: the space. Despite being close to everything, the space is quiet, private, and feels like you can escape from the crowds at the end of the day. The pictures are as the space appears, only it‚Äôs even more charming in person. The light in the mornings is unbeatable. Third (and by no means least) off: the host.

Just a few minutes walk (two short blocks) from the trendy, exciting, engrossing main drag of South Congress, it\'s somehow also very quiet and feels very secluded. You couldn\'t wish for a better location. I referred to this place as ""the treehouse"" throughout my stay ‚Äì even though it\'s not technically a treehouse, you feel like you\'re in the canopy of the big tree outside. I loved my visit to Austin, but honestly I could have spent the entire time in this studio. Very comfortable bed, excellent air conditioning, quiet and serene. The bath alone was worth the price of admission. And Ashton was a super responsive host, very helpful with some pretty random questions I had. All in all, this place will definitely be my top pick for next time I\'m in town!', ""What a fantastic spot! Both the unit itself and the surrounding community. Ashton provides some GREAT recommendations and we tried as many as we could in our short time there. Just as described, it's a walkable distance to SO many great places. We found that other than visiting a couple of beer gardens farther out (we had a car), all the rest of our dining and entertainment was spent within walking distance of Ashton's place. For being a studio type unit, we were impressed with the great kitchen amenities (although we only used the coffee maker - too many great restaurants!), and the large bathroom. Bed was comfy, and even though you're only 2 blocks from So Congress, it's very quiet. Parking was also a huge plus if you happen to have a car. Sincerely hoping we'll have the opportunity to stay here again. This was our first visit to Austin, but hopefully not the last! Thank you, Ashton!"", ""Ashton's place is perfect for a couple that wants to be close to the action in Austin but in a quiet place that has everything you need.

Unit was very cute and spacious. Backyard had a nice sitting area that we enjoyed. Beds were very comfy and bathroom upstairs was large with modern updates.\nOverall we really enjoyed our stay, but there are a few downsides to the unit. The upstairs gets hot even though we had the thermostat set at 70. (note, we went in the summer.) If you close the bedroom doors, like we did, it didn't feel like the A/C was getting into the rooms. Luckily floor and ceiling fans come with the unit which was helpful. The unit is also a little too dark for my liking, although it does have some large windows in the living room and kitchen which brings in some light."", 'Walkable to Barton Springs and the bike/walk trail.

Ride shares were cheap and quick to get us around in the evening. The home itself was cozy & exactly as pictured!

While the house is seemingly on the older side, Linda is always extremely attentive and always makes sure things are maintained. I had an extended stay with Linda and I saw her work relentlessly to keep the place in ship shape. I also love how quaint the neighborhood is, as well as the location of the stay. Linda is also an amazing person! She really did everything in her power to make the stay feel like I was at home. We shared meals occasionally and she proved to be a fascinating conversationalist, but she was never overbearing and when I needed space she basically let me have the place to myself.\nI think my favorite part of the stay was the reliability of the house and of Linda. Not once did I have to worry about things not going according to plan and I was able to get into a good routine after about three days. Travel is always hard because you get so out of your own normal but Linda understands that and so is willing to adapt to your normality to make the stay as enjoyable as possible.\nI am greatly appreciative of the time I spent in this fun little house and hope someday I cross paths with Linda again as she truly is somebody to befriend. The spirit of the house, with its ecclectic indoor spaces as well as Cactus filled outdoor spaces exceeds all expectations of any stay in Austin. Linda and her home embody the spontaneity of the city, and yet still provides the reliability of normality for travelers.\nIf you are looking for a place to stay in Austin there is not a more enjoyable place. Over my stay throughout the summer of 2021 I lived in three different locations, and Linda's blew the others out of the water in every way possible.

The fun and tastiness of Rainey St was literally less than a block away. We have used Airbnb for years, but have never experienced a host who answered messages as rapidly as Himesh did. That makes a BIG difference to us since I usually have several places I look at at a time and tend to want ""immediate gratification!""

We‚Äôd have preferred firmer mattresses-these are deep and soft, but they worked & we slept ok. Austin set temp records during our week-long stay, so we spent more time inside than had intended. The AC worked fine, as did the TV, WI-FI, microwave, small fridge, electric teakettle (with big selection of teas), and the coffee maker with 4 ground and whole bean varieties.', 'Clean, well stocked, and comfortable.

She gave many useful tips in terms of restaurants, music places, shops etc. The room had every imaginable convenience, and when it rained she closed the window and added to umbrellas to the accessories. The area is lovely, green, close to restaurants and a great bakery. If you like a bit of a walk, you can walk to downtown Austin.

Seriously one of the best stays we had since using AirBnB. Marilyn was so kind and so communicative and really made our stay amazing! Something I would like to mention that I think was a huge plus was the shower. We were in town for ACL and walked to Zilker everyday and let me tell you having an amazing large shower to walk in and just reset after a long day of music was a god send. I really really appreciate the kindness and help Marilyn showed us while we were in town. Absolutely best location in Austin with the best host!

A genuinely cozy & welcoming vibe interior space with thoughtful amenities. I appreciated the ability to walk mornings in the neighborhood as if one was a resident. Simply a jewel!', 'This turned out to be one of my favorite AirBnB stays. I was in Austin for SXSW and this spot in the Zilker neighborhood was a welcome respite from the organized chaos of the festival. But the real star is the host, Marilyn. She went above and beyond.

Marilyn provides an abundance of tea, coffee, milk and all the toiletries you need. The beds are so comfortable.\nMurphysOak is located in a lovely quiet, safe, tree lined neighbourhood. We had no transport so we either walked, used the bus or Uber. It is about a 45 minute walk to downtown, or 20 minute walk to a bus stop and a $10 Uber ride from downtown.\nMarilyn and Larry are wonderful hosts who go above and beyond to make for a fabulous stay. We were in Austin for the Grand Prix but had no transport. They drove us to the grocery store and took our shopping home so that we could mooch around unencumbered.

It's not a big space, but within the space you do have most everything you need to relax and enjoy your stay. I feel like Carrye takes great care to consider how to make guests feel at home.\nThis was one of our rare times of staying someplace without a full kitchen. We normally make our own food & intentionally select places with full kitchens on trips but not with Austin. If you are visiting Austin, it would be a tragedy if you did not partake in the plethora of different food options in the city - so the guesthouse not having a full kitchen should not be an issue at all. And on that note, there are plenty of food options nearby and Carrye has great suggestions for where to eat and anything else you might be wanting to do in Austin.\nThe neighborhood is great. The guesthouse was immaculately clean, and the bed was comfy. Having that along with an extremely kind and helpful host made our visit to the Zilker Guesthouse top notch.

The unit is a great place to stay for two people, as long as you're planning on going out for meals, since there's no stove. Disposable utensils are provided so we were able to microwave some leftovers, and the fridge was big enough to store some yogurt and fruit for breakfast. There isn't a dining area inside, but there's a shaded bench in the yard.\nThe neighborhood is quiet and convenient (walking distance) to both Zilker Park and Barton Springs, as well as the plentiful restaurant options on South Lamar, South 1st, Barton Springs and Riverside.

Everything on our intinerary was no more than 10-15 minutes away from the house which meant more time for family and activities! would definitely stay here again :)', ""One of the cleanest and nicest Airbnbs I've stayed at. It looked just like the pictures. Sylvie includes everything you'd need and some nice extras like snacks and device chargers. While the house is far enough away from the main street, there is some minor street noise in the neighborhood. I found a white noise machine resolved this and it's now available for future guests to use if they'd like. Sylvie was very responsive to a couple of questions and wanted to ensure we fully enjoyed our stay. The location is great and so accessible to tons of good restaurants and anywhere you'd want to go in the Austin area. The backyard is nice and private. I would recommend staying here."", 'Sylvie‚Äôs place was perfect! We had three couples staying for an extended weekend in Austin. There were bars and restaurants close enough to walk, a well-stocked kitchen so we made our own meals one day, and it‚Äôs an easy ride to downtown. We loved it and would absolutely stay here again.
