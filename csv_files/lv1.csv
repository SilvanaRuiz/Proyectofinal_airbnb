There’s a market a couple blocks away, so we walked to get some food supplies for breakfast & a couple lunches.\nThis room is not close to the strip, but that ensured it was quiet and restful. The bus stop is just around the corner, so we usually took the bus to the strip each day and then Ubered back. $5 for 24-hour bus pass. $30-ish for Uber to airport or downtown.

Plus, it was an uncomfortable situation even if they did send a tech at 2am. My wife and I had ear plugs so that helped to get thru the night. Aside from this, a couple other non-working items such as the phone (only works on speaker mode and you have to figure what button to press to make it work), the light/magnifier that’s used when putting on make up didn’t work (no light), and the faucet in the living space was unusable due to extremely low pressure.

I love that the rooms are in a gated building, so it made me feel safe no matter what time (day and night) I left and went back. It’s walking distance to small shops, too. This a good option for solo travelers or a small group.', 'Everything was great and the apartment is exactly as described in the advertisement.\nWe felt very comfortable there.', 'The apartment provides all you need for a short-term stay, but the guest experience can be easily improved with minor changes. there is a all space in front of the fridge that could use a table with a few seats, instead of that weird thing. More comforters for the winter time, since the heater is not enough to keep you warm. And most important: cleaning. A lot of hair on the bathroom and the apartment floor and bathroom. That needs attention ASAP. The location is excellent, though.', 'Maria was very communicative and understanding. She and bill were super supportive and amazing hosts.

The room was a very nice space except for the smell, I did not identify if the previous occupant was smoking or was an unbearable smell of smoke that did not come off at any time, I returned with my bags filled with that smell.

Mind you, that fee stands as is, whether one day or multiple day booking...Aside from that ""huh"" moment with the trash, I definitely will stay again.', 'The property was as advertised. Just off the strip, close to the Thomas & Mack arena and in a seemingly safe area with security cameras on the premises. I had a quiet stay and nobody bothered me.

It’s quiet and serene, love the quiet hours at night so you get a full nights rest, there’s a laundry room available for guests, and overall has a very homey, warm feeling to the place. We felt very safe and secure with the 24/7 surveillance and locked iron gates. The area is amazing, with great food, shops, bars, and all a short walk or bike ride away! Definitely recommending this place to all of my friends and colleagues.

The listing is totally accurate and communication with Maria was fast and efficient.

The apartment was in a reasonable but somewhat dated condition. But nothing that one cannot be cool with."", 'Love the location!', ""This listing was perfect for what I needed. Maria was great at communicating instructions, and the price was unbeatable. The cleanilness could have been better, but it wasn't anything major in my opinion. The space heater was MUCH appreciated because I get cold easily, and there is no central heat. Water pressure and temperature is perfect. There wasn't a convenient place to plug in your phone if you want it right by the bed. But if you care about that, I suppose you could bring or ask for an extension cord. I'll definitely stay here again if they'll have me!"", 'This studio is perfect for place to sleep! If you’re looking for something quick, convenient and budget friendly. Maria is very responsive. It’s very close to the strip as well as lots of places around. Apartments were quiet and came with everything you need. Would definitely book again!', 'Very unsafe! I had to check out the very next day as the area is really sketchy. People shouting at night and very very strange individuals outside the building. Little privacy in the room with blinds and only partly covered with curtains.\nAfter I was out safely from there, I reached out to BNB and Maria about the issue. Maria told me I should have gotten a bodyguard if I was feeling unsafe and for BNB, the pictures I provided was not enough to take any actions. End of the day I lost $412 and now I realize why they have a no refund policy.\nI would not recommend this place from my personal experience.', 'Great space. Comfy bed. The court yard is adorable and Maria was super helpful with checkin and checkout.', 'The place was as described. For the price it was awesome. Check in was fast and easy. We stayed in January so the space heater was not sufficient for the first night we stayed. I would recommend keeping the heater on all day to keep warm. The bed was comfortable and the water pressure and temperature was great. The place was clean for the most part but It can definitely use a good dusting. The tv and WiFi worked great for the down time we had. I would definitely recommend this place.', 'Cute place, easily accessible and not too far from the strip.', 'Loves the stay will always come back here', 'Great value and perfect communication, thanks again!', 'The $80 cleaning fee is quite excessive. It costs more to clean then one night to stay.', 'Maria is nice and seems great. Inside of the place was clean and as advertised. More blankets would have been nice, luckily I had been camping prior to my stay and had extra in my car. As a single youngish woman I may not have chosen this place had I known the neighborhood it’s in, I didn’t feel safe walking around outside and would rush in and out to my car for this reason. The apartment isn’t very private, I had to finagle the curtain to block myself from being seen from outside while lying in the bed. Also wish I had known about the very loud airplanes flying overhead through the night. All that being said, nothing bad happened and I turned on the fan to block the noise outside and had a warm place to say for an ok price.', 'No complaints other than lots of airport noise which is just comes with the location.

If you are doing things on the Strip, it’s a great place to stay.', 'everything was as described and the check in was easy as pie.', 'Upon my check in here I noticed it was pretty cold in the room, as it was only about 30° outside , thats when we realized the only heat available in this room was a space heater that was barely heating anything at all so I messaged Maria about it and I took a shower and immediately noticed how dirty the tub was and the floors also there was a bathroom window with no lock whatsoever, anyone couldhavecame in! When i got out of the shower I heard someone at the door who was trying to come in with a key so i immediately yelled through the door at the person and then he yelled back asking me if i had a leak in my unit because there was water leaking into the bathroom beneath me and i told him no which he then tried to come in again as im still standing there in a towel and I yelled through again and asked him what he needed and he was still asking about a leak which i did not have so finally he says that he is leaving me ANOTHER space heater outside the door. We messaged Maria again letting her know that we did not feel comfortable nor safe there and we would like to check out the next morning to which she told me theres a strict no refund policy (which now I see why) so we contact air BNB support to which says they also cannot do anything without pictures of the man trying to come in which makes no sense! We stayed there the first night and literally rearranged the furniture to place in front of the door because of how scared we were! Two small town women in Las Vegas one of the biggest sex trafficking cities ever and we are now in a place where there were hobos sleeping outside of the gated building and the inside had very strange men walking around it asking us personal questions, and now we know that our window DOES NOT lock and theres a man who lives there as ""maintenance"" who clearly had a key to our unit and didn\'t mind coming on in while i was standing there in nothing but a towel! There\'s a reason the rate is cheap on here but for ehat you get it should be even lower! I dont see how anyone could sleep comfortably there. We left the very next morning and checked into a hotel and never went back yet we were charged for the whole stay anyways. Very bad business and very unsafe! I expected air BNB to at least value our safety and be more helpful but their policy is having to have photo proof which is absolutely absurd.', 'Fantastic place\nGreat location\nOutstanding customer service\n10 mins max from the airport\nParking available\n30 mins walk to the strip\nNo complaints here', 'I would highly recommend this apartment.

It is Vegas, and close to the strip. parking lot is not really enclosed so, I'd suggest at least not leaving anything in your car.

Convenient location, and for the price, it was worth it. I do have some suggestions though :)"", 'Maria was very responsive to my phone calls about anything that might have came up.', 'Nice economical place to stay near the strip!

Room was clean and fresh.', 'Great little place for the price. You definitely can hear planes flying over head, but I didn’t notice it much. Perfect for a few nights business stay.', 'Would 100% come back again walkable distance and a place that made driving to more then just the strip convenient.', 'This Airbnb fit our needs perfectly. Super easy check in/check out and was easy to get in touch as needed. It was about $7-10 to anywhere on the strip or we walked which was an easy walk. It’s also located next to White Castle, a dispensary, and other fast food places.', 'Just a bad situation overall, “non smoking room” smelled like someone smoked a whole pack before we arrived. The bed was right in vision to the outdoor and wasn’t really private.', 'True to pictures, a nice studio that doesn’t share walls with neighboring units.

She was very responsive and made up for all the little deficiencies. The shower was great! Good pressure and plenty of hot water. Good location if you rent a car. Really great VALUE!\nThe not so good: The place was noisy; if the wind is wrong you’ll have planes going overhead all day. We could hear everyone’s TV (at odd hours), showers and maids servicing other rooms. We became used to the smell of cigarette smoke(expected in Vegas). The kitchen needed a light bulb. Room needs more hooks for coats and other things. I’d get rid of the armoire and put a small table for the 2 chairs. The bed was decent but needs a headboard and more pillows; one more per person would better.\nOverall, worth the price and not aggrieved at all!', 'Great quality/price ratio.

One thing to note: the tub jets did not work, which was a bummer. On the other hand, we were pleased to be able to access the balcony, which we didn't expect as the balconies were not open when we booked - it was so nice to be able to check out the Vegas skyline in the evening.

We were there for 3 days and nights and we like to prepare meals at home so we aren't always having to spend excessive cash on eating out.

When my partner and I make our annual trip to Sin City, we typically find a place and use it just as a place to stay. With this location, we actually felt the draw to wander around and have fun with the places in the hotel (such as the rooftop bar/lounge, the buffet, and more) rather than seeking out an entertainment-and-food hop from resort to resort. Also—if you're an artist or love contemporary arts, the Palms has a bunch of Damien Hirst artworks, which was a big plus for me to be able to see in person while drinking, gambling, and all the other Vegas necessities.\nEdward was the most amazing and helpful host we could have asked for. He was very responsive and made sure our stay was good as it could be. Definitely considering booking this stay if it's available for next year's pilgrimage!"", ""Great place to stay! It's off the strip enough to be away from the madness, but close enough that you're a cheap Lyft ride away. The overhead shower was almost worth the price of admission by itself.

We felt that it could have been more accommodating for guests instead of the ""bare minimum"" of certain things.\nWe understand the concept, and see the vision of what this place could be, but it still has a ways to go to be worth the $$ spent.

We both agreed to all of the following: This place has a strong stench/musky smell right when you enter. There are no windows besides the door you enter through. The A/C is very loud and does not meet the wanted temperature; it was on overnight- even brought it up to 85, but felt like 70 or lower. I ended up doubling up on my clothes. Their neighbor's dog barked nonstop overnight and it echoed through the A/C. There are brown, moldy stains in the bathroom- makes sense bc there is no ventilation in the bathroom. There were 2 long strands of hair on the towel and it made us question the cleanliness of the place on top of everything else we noticed. In addition, their bedsheets/pillowcases are super thin. Even if the sheets/cases are washed, not sure how clean the pillows/mattress actually are. Probably one of the worst sleeps at an airbnb.

The only issues i had:\n1) i had to reach out to them after not having any instructions for check-in of any kind sent to me within an hour of checking in - strange, tho he did respond promptly.\n2) the space badly needs a few simple amenities to make it much better - a hot plate would have greatly expanded food options during the stay, as well as more and better flatware and more plates/cups. this is particularly true, given that there is no dish washer. the flatware is the cheeapest i have ever seen, trumping even IKEA flatware, which was odd.\n3) there were ants in the kitchen. i tried to figure out where they were coming from but was unsuccessful. this, even tho i was fastidious, and never left any food of any kind oit at all.', 'Nice place to stay with easy access to the strip.', 'This was a great stay!
