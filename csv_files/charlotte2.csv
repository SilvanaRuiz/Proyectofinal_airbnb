At this moment, the ad still proudly boasts ""free parking on premises.""\nOtherwise, pretty good for the price. The neighborhood is really nice and mostly quiet with plenty of trees.

However she quickly FedExd me my glasses after I left them behind and even offered to bring them to me at the airport!\nThe locality is upscale, very quiet and peaceful. A shopping complex is five minutes' drive, including a large Publix with extended opening hours, and a large petrol station. Parking is super easy, right outside the property."", 'This is an excellent Airbnb listing and we are grateful for the effort Penny has placed into creating the space available.

Even though the location is just above her garage, I felt like I was in my own home. Her place is worth so much more than the amount that I paid. I will definitely use her place again if I ever travel to Charlotte 🙂', 'This is a great find in the Cotswold area. Fantastic location and everything one needs for a short stay. The apartment is spacious and private. You do need to park on the street and walk down Penny’s drive to access the unit but the street is well lit and it is in a very safe area.

Absolutely would recommend to others….10/10 host and accommodations.', ""For my stay in CLT, strong wifi and close proximity to Matthews and Uptown were my primary concerns. Penny's place met those requirements with ease.\nThe unit is private, well-furnished, and is also genuinely the best smelling Airbnb that I've visited!\nThe only point I could consider a downside is that the garage door opening can be kind of noisy - but it's a very infrequent issue and did not have any major impact on my stay."", ""Penny's place was a steal!

Easy to get in, the place is spacious and the bed is comfy. Kitchenette, fridge and bathroom were spotless. Very quiet spot, even when a neighbor was leaf blowing briefy as I came in I could barely hear it inside. Never heard a garage door. Amazing value, I will be back the next time I'm in Charlotte."", 'Penny was responsive to our questions. We had a lovely, relaxing weekend.', 'Me and my friend had such a great stay! Penny’s listing was located in such a convenient area that had multiple food options in addition to retail and grocery stores. The house was also only a short 10 min drive to Uptown which made it easy to get to downtown while still having the luxury of being in a secluded and private neighborhood.\nPenny was such a lovely host and very responsive. There was a little ant problem but Penny made sure to give us a heads up prior to our arrival.

Not the entire property. If i knew, I wouldn't have booked it. I walked in to water dripping from the indoor AC Unit, onto a towel they placed on the floor. I went through 3 towels, soaking up water. Water leaked into the light switch panel. Key fob is located in a weird place in the garage. Unclear Instructions on how to access it. At the unit, the door needs to be Lifted Up with 1 hand, while you turn the lock to lock it.

I called numerous times on Saturday never got what I asked for. BIGGEST THING: the front door. The door to the actual apartment does not lock. The door is not properly aligned with the lock so anyone at any time could just come inside the apartment while you’re there or while you’re out which is so unsafe! Especially for women traveling.

Also they have a noise and smoking monitor in the apartment which that isn’t listed on the listing just told to you after you book! I think all rules should be listed prior to booking so you are fully aware of what you’re booking. They told us about a noise monitor and no smoking on the property at all rule after booking and two days before our trip! Not a problem for us because we aren’t smokers but if I was I’d liked to know that I cannot smoke anywhere on this property prior to booking.

They had watered down soap for hand soap instead of actually filling it with soap they just put water. The studio was muggy when we got there and had a bit of a weird smell. All of this ultimately resulting in me not showering or really even staying there. The first night we slept there, that’s it.

The bed had been made but bedding was not clean. When I pulled back the sheets there was hair. So I pulled off the sheets, the mattress was awful. They have the wrong mattress cover. The floors weren't swept, rug was't vacuumed and it smelled awful. I was so disappointed. I contacted Jasmine and asked about the stains on the mattress. She responded immediately but her response was did I pull off the sheet. That shouldn't matter. Please throw that mattress out. They refunded me the cleaning fee but I spent more than that to get the place clean and for the mattress. The bathroom sink and bathtub was clogged. They had someone come unclog it but they only unclog the sink. We unclogged the tub.Then I had to get mail sent. They kept sending me the link to pay the $25 but it wasn't working.

Everything was as it was pictured. There is also a cute little fenced in courtyard between the detached garage and house with grill and picnic table. When we first walked in the house it was immediately noticable how clean it was; immaculate throughout. We brought some things we’re used to bringing, coffee, etc., but we didn’t need it; Andrea had already provided it.😊. They were very specific about their directions which were easy to follow. Check out was super easy; basically just take the trash out, put towels in front of W&D, leave bed linens on the beds. 👍🏼. The beds were very comfortable. There was plenty of space for the four of us and our local family who came by briefly. The location was perfect for us because it was 10 minutes from my son’s and his family but it’s close enough to the city without being in the city.🏙️ We were in town for my grandsons 2nd b’day at Jetton Park and a baby shower for my DIL at the Harbor Club in Davidson.', 'Really clean.Comfortable and nice!!!', 'Great place', 'This was my 2nd stay at Patrick and Andrea’s airbnb.

The instructions to get in were very well written. Arriving late it was pitch black and no lights were on. The garage door was not connected, we got in but had to walk around to the side gate, to the rear entrance. Owner was responsive. There is not readily available street parking - only back alley and on a slant. Not ideal. The house itself felt like a rental. Kitchen was well stocked as were bathrooms. The master bed was comfortable but the guest beds were not. It was very clean. I'd recommend a lock on the front door for easier access as late night entry is dark and the back stairs were literally falling apart. This is a hazard. The only TV had issues. Roku wasn't working and you need a separate phone app. The Nest heating/cooling was working until our last night when it was locked. It got way too hot and I had no ability to even turn it off.

As I made a payment and went into the building, the host was awake and answered all of my questions as needed despite it being the deep midnight. However, the room number does not match the title where I booked. It is not a big deal because this will happen, and all bookers will go through when picking up the room key. In addition, the fan in the bathroom was not working even though I turned the switch on, so the bathroom was humid whenever I got out of the shower. That was the biggest concern, but it was not a significant problem that offended me. Again, I am not saying the stay was not a good experience.

This really exacerbated my asthma, to the point I needed my emergency inhaler overnight and multiple times the next day. I ended up super tired and sick heading into my vacation, which was very frustrating.\nThe second issue (more minor) was that there is no pool and no coffee pot in room as listed.

We were in town for a wedding with our kids and so the house was perfect for easy breakfasts and then heading out for festivities, crashing at night.

We did have one issue with one of the beds breaking, but honestly, the mattress was so comfortable that we pulled it over to the floor and slept great! Logan was also very responsive about this issue. Only other thing to note, there was no kitchen table. We made do with the coffee table and the outdoor seating/table (but we had good weather!). If you are planning on more than just quick/meals and snacks, this might be an issue, but it wasn't for us. Overall, we really had a great time, the location was perfect, beautiful and peaceful neighborhood.

We spent lots of time at the pool which had just opened for the season. The owners were very responsive and provided everything we needed. Listed says not recommended for kids due to the glass table and rug but we just moved the table out of the way and used a sheet to cover the rug just in case. It served as a nice movie spot for the girls. Parking at the unit was a breeze and they provided two parking passes for our vehicles. The pool is located behind the building where the unit is and is just a short walk away. While at the pool we were warmly welcomed and provided with wristbands to get in each day. The atmosphere was very family friendly and they even gave the kids lunch and snacks while we were there. The kids shared pool toys some of which were provided by the owners and it was a very chill vibe. Many of the residents we met talked highly of the owners of the property and how much they had done to improve the area and all they do for the residents. It was very much a community feel and vibe. We never saw the family that was right next door to our unit but did see the young men that lived right above us. They were friendly and respectful and we did not hear any noise coming from their apartment. Location was close to downtown (about 15 minutes away) where we visited the Discovery Place Science Center. It was definitely a win for the kids.

Overall great experience!', ""Overall, my stay had its ups and downs. The community was pleasantly quiet. However, upon arrival, my initial impression was less than ideal. There were people sitting out front on the balcony above the unit, which was unexpected and affected the sense of privacy I was hoping for. The pictures on the Airbnb listing had led me to believe that the unit was bright and luxurious, but in reality, it didn't quite live up to those expectations. Although the unit appeared clean at first glance, there were certain issues that became apparent during my stay. There was an unpleasant smell of cigarettes/weed that lingered, which was quite off-putting. I noticed some areas that needed more attention in terms of cleanliness, such as the top of the fridge and the door to the microwave. The interior furnishings left much to be desired as well. More attention to detail and some renovations are definitely needed to make this Airbnb a more appealing option for future guests."", 'Went down to Charlotte and stayed at this gorgeous airbnb.

There are no excess supplies (garbage bags or toilet paper) located in the unit so be sure to bring your own. The apartments location itself is also another downfall ( it’s in the hood) not very luxury at all & The tenants living upstairs are very loud, sounds like someone’s banging all night.

I did NOT think this would be around our area—a clean location nestled in a quiet neighborhood. When I looked at the address of the home, I wondered how ""busy"" the area would be like, but it was VERY quiet! The outdoor hot tub was also nice, and with the bubbles rolling and the fan circulating, you didn\'t hear any vehicle driving by. The heated bathroom floor added some extra flare along with the other ""upgraded"" items in the bathroom. The home was trendy and felt very much like a home away from home. The kitchen was furnished well, and again very functional.\nI would and more than likely WILL stay here again. Great location to just get away..even if for only 1 night! A MUST STAY!', ""This is a great space in a great location. The design is very cool, and I love what they've done with the space. I used to frequent this side of town as a teen, and I was surprised by the amount of growth in this location. This is a great location for people who want to be outside the Charlotte epicenter but still have access to restaurants and local shopping. The home's interior has a cool conservatory appeal, and the placement of windows and mirrors allows you to appreciate North Carolina's beautiful trees and neighborhood wildlife (squirrels, rabbits, and birds). We enjoyed the hot tube and firepit when our little one went to sleep or took a nap. Those little moments were a great Christmas gift for Mom and Dad. The beds were some of the most comfortable I've ever slept in. We took lots of naps. I highly recommend this for a quiet space that's close to the city but not too close :) You're gonna enjoy it.""]",['5 guests · 2 bedrooms · 2 beds · 1 bath'],https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/836190196259374976?adults=1&children=0&enable_m3_private_room=true&infants=0&pets=0&search_mode=regular_search&check_in=2024-10-27&check_out=2024-11-01&source_impression_id=p3_1729548858_P3Xy30LcVTdR20Pn&previous_page_section_name=1000&federated_search_id=0234dfbc-533b-4e23-bfea-9efc2b384471

I am not a super light sleeper so I did not have trouble with t\nhe garage door opening. If I was asleep I slept right through it. If I was awake it wasn’t extremely loud. At first I just thought it was the heat/ac kicking on. I also used the noise machine they have there which is awesome!\n2.

We are not big fans of the city life and so, although we were forced to be in the city for business reasons, that backyard was our little getaway to make us feel like we were still surrounded by nature. The neighborhood was quiet And peaceful. Yet the location was incredibly ideal, keeping us close to everything that we needed to be close to. Matthew was very helpful in suggesting places including a gym for us to work out in. Overall, I will definitely stay here again. In fact, I actually just talked to my second we care for next month.', ""We enjoyed another great stay at Matthew's renovated bungalow. It's big enough that the three of us could spread out a bit but also cozy. The location is perfect for us as we were visiting relatives in the area. Would love to stay there again!"", 'We can’t say enough about our gratitude for this place. We travel a lot, so we hop from one Airbnb to another.\nThis is by far our favorite space to stay. It’s incredibly private yet incredibly central in this location. The house is spotless and has everything you could need for a stay, including a longer stay which we usually opt for. There’s two private parking spaces, which is so important for us because we travel to and fro business meetings all day long.\nMatthew has always made himself available for us, not that we’ve actually needed him even once.. I appreciate when all the little details are thought about ahead of time so that we don’t need to call upon the host.', 'Beautiful bungalow that has literally everything you need. Perfect getaway spot', 'Our group had a pleasant stay at Matthew’s house. Downtown was just a quick Uber ride away, which we liked. The house was fully stocked with everything we could possibly need. One thing that needs to be fixed and known to other guests is the bathroom doors. Both bathrooms have sliding doors but no locks. One of the bathrooms has a considerable gap, and since there is no lock or anything to latch on, people passing by can see into the bathroom. Hopefully, the host will address these issues so future guests can have more privacy. Other than that, no other complaints. We had a great time in Charlotte and will definitely come back again. 😊', 'Location was very convenient to uptown Charlotte, Matthew was responsive. Outside of that, the outside of the house needs to be power washed(spiderwebs all over the outside) Deck feels like it’s gonna break down on top of that I see a couple water bugs in the deck. Inside of the home, HVAC was filthy, missing lightbulbs, cracked tiles in the kitchen. House is very old and needs proper maintenance, pictures are very deceiving', 'Matthew’s bungalow was just as described. We really appreciated the coffee pods for the machine and the toiletries provided. The bungalow was spotlessly clean and tidy.\nLocation was great, just a short drive of 7 minutes to uptown.\nMatthew was very easy to communicate with and always responded really quickly to any questions we had.\nWe would definitely return to Matthew’s place.', 'A comfortable stay', 'The house is very nice !

We used to own two air bibs so we are quite picky. This was immaculate in its cleanliness and had more than enough amenities and even extras for us!

Clean.', ""This was a great Airbnb to stay at if you visit Charlotte. This place is spacious. We are a family of 4 and had plenty room to stretch out. The place was also stocked with plenty of towels, soap and lotions. The kitchen is also well stocked as well. The city is literally a 7 minute drive and the interstate is close and takes you all around the city. The only feedback is that there are mosquitoes everywhere and will fly into the house without notice. It's nothing you can really do about that, except keep the doors closed. Overall, this was a great place. Would return again."", 'Awesome host', 'Matthew is very responsive and a great communicator. He was prompt in giving a secure option to the house when there was a problem with the lock, and had a locksmith fix the lock as fast as possible.\n-\nUnfortunately, it did not feel like the house was properly prepared for our stay. There were a number of areas in the house that could use another maintenance pass. The bathroom laundry wasn’t complete and needed to be dried, the seals on the doors were not enough to keep bugs out, the a/c filter and fans were very dusty, the second bathroom moulding is coming apart and has a shower rod that’s rusting and falling off its support, the amount of dirt/dust on the floors required, at least, socks to be worn, the cleaning supplies in the house was either empty or dusty with little trace of use, and the living room fan/light remote was out of batteries and unable to be used.\n-\nThe house is in a convenient location in the city, but could use some touchups for ensuring guest comfort.', 'The stay was enjoyable, and Matthew was a great host.

We came to Mooresville for the Carolina Renaissance Festival, and had a wonderful time. We enjoyed the rustic feel of Cheznee’s home, it was easy to check into and came with complete instructions. My only critique was that when booking, wifi was listed as an amenity of the place, but that status changed in the property notes before our actual trip date, and we didn’t get fantastic hotspot service. We had a great time staying there anyway, and loved the property, but you may need to double check on the status of listing amenities when booking! This is, however, a great property to relax and unplug with friends and spend some quality time in the country!', 'We really enjoyed our stay in North Carolina!

The backyard and woods is a great amenity to have for walking dogs. I did mention a couple of minor items to her: overuse of air fresheners, and clutter in the closets, but I'm sure she will take action to remedy these things so I would for sure consider her place for my next stay in the Charlotte area."", 'Great little house in the country perfect for some quiet time.

Plenty of anything we needed-soap, shampoo, hair dryer, toilet paper, paper towels, etc. The property was nice to walk our dogs on. I spent some time relaxing on the front porch.

A very nice, country setting.', 'We stayed at this beautiful home in the countryside and found it to be very peaceful and private. Our dogs absolutely loved the spacious yard to play in. The house felt cozy and had all the amenities we needed to cook and feel at home. However, there were a few drawbacks: the microwaves didn’t work, the bathroom drain was a bit slow, and the house is definitely older, which showed in some areas. Additionally, there were quite a few restrictions and rules, which made it feel less like a vacation home. Despite these issues, we loved the town and overall enjoyed our stay.', 'What a great place!

It was adorably decorated for Christmas and had everything we needed. It was a quiet area, and the yard was nice to walk our dogs around. While it was for the most part very clean, there was mold on the bathroom ceiling. There were also like 7 plug-in air fresheners, scented candles, and puff air fresheners that were very strong. As someone who has migraines triggered by strong artificial smells, we had to go around and unplug them all and open all the windows to air the place out.

It is great that this place was pet friendly but also specifically cat friendly! Our furry friend was very comfortable and happy looking out the windows.

Cheznees place was exactly as described and pictured. Per a couple other reviews, yes the kitchen sink faucet does drip a little but If you push it all the way to the side and align the handle just right it doesn’t make a sound, be creative, it is an older sink so you have to show some type of understanding here. Everything was great, and the holiday decorations and candy canes were even better.

Nicely outside of the towns but convenient to Davidson where i was visiting friends.', 'It was our first experience with an Airbnb. We felt right at home. Cheznee emailed us several days before our scheduled arrival to notify us that the AC was not working and offered a refund if we wanted to go to another place. We chose to keep our reservation and fortunately, the AC was repaired before we arrived.

There were some items already there that we didn't have to run right out and buy like condiments, paper towels, coffee... that was nice.

It held a laptop and 2 fairly large monitors I brought with me."", ""My husband and I loved staying here. We felt so comfortable and right at home in Cheznee's home.

Shower cleanliness was a bit disappointing but nothing serious. Host handled it quickly. I was impressed with the host's responsiveness.

Basically was told the area is popular and that there should be a laundromat close by. I had a load of soaked clothes. I get it was a holiday weekend but just found that rude. Also, there were perishable foods open in the fridge and dirty dishes in the oven. We didn’t use the oven or fridge so that wasn’t a huge deal but makes me wonder how good the cleaning process is. The sheets did appear clean. If you like dark to sleep being an eye cover because it is super bright in the bedroom. No front entrance porch light if you arrive late.', 'This was an awesome stay!

Highly recommend if you’re wanting to stay in Southend!', 'Great location', 'This is an incredible place to stay by a great host. It’s very serene and private. It’s a nice part of town and very walkable to many great locations. Getting up to the front entry is a flight of steep stairs but not a problem even with heavy luggage. But if you have a handicap that limits the stair climbing, I would steer clear. Once inside it’s quite amazing. A lovely porch overlooking a quiet street. A very comfortable living room. Although I did not cook while I was there, the kitchen had every gadget one would need. It even had a pantry where you could purchase items. Again, I did not use these, but the fact that the host thought of these was incredible. I thought the bedroom was wonderful and the mattress was foam but very supportive. Plenty of ample pillows and linens. The bathroom was small but more than adequate and it was very clean. If I had one complaint, it would be that I like more water pressure in the shower. But that’s very typical of homes in this neighborhood.', 'Great stay, perfect location', 'Place was clean and very well laid out.

Lot’s of steps but that was fine for me, may not be for others who are less mobile.', ""Honestly, just really happy I found a place with a good bed. It's always a struggle to find a king sized bed and one that allows for good sleep, usually AirBnB beds are hard and awful. The AirBnB was clean, in a great location where I could walk to coffee shops and other places to eat — Early Girl is my staple and The Salty Doughnut. It was also VERY quiet with no loud neighbors, some traffic noise but still was able to get a good nights rest"", 'Perfect location to restaurants and bars!

Great for a short weekend and the location was perfect.', 'We only stayed a couple of nights, but Chamberlain was very friendly and responded extremely fast any time communication was needed.

Great location, very comfortable and clean.', 'This is a great spot if location is most important to you. The tv in the bedroom seemed to have a slow connection and we couldn’t get movies or shows to load. The shower pressure in the bathroom is very light as well (not a deal breaker but just something to note). We stayed here for a wedding weekend and there was lots of ‘getting ready’ to do, and with long hair the water pressure matters. There’s signs everywhere for a 24 hour pantry with a link to purchase things online but no instructions for how to do get those things. The host wasn’t responsive in helping us get the things we ordered, but rather told us that’s only for items already in the pantry and didn’t help us get a refund. There were only random packs of oatmeal and a single box of pasta in the pantry.', 'Super cute place nearby lots of stuff to do and good food! Thoroughly enjoyed our stay!', 'This place was perfect for walking to south end coffee shops, breweries, restaurants, etc. A bit of steep stairs to get to the house and into the apartment upstairs. House was super clean, bed was comfy. Only thing that bothered me was the water and ice maker in the refrigerator did not work.', 'Location is perfect , walkable .5mi north or south to plenty of businesses/things to do. Neighborhood is peaceful. Bed very comfortable. Towels provided were a little basic, and I had to go buy my own soap. Traveling via air here may want to keep that in mind, soap/shampoo not provided. Convenient store at the corner has some bars of soap. I’d stay here again, check in was clear and easy, neighborhood quiet and centrally located.

We fell in love with charlotte and will absolutely be back. The private patio was so nice to enjoy coffee on in the mornings. The bed and linens were super comfy.

Easy check in, clean, and beautiful. The location is great and we had such a good time exploring Charlotte, no Ubers necessary.

I would stay definitely stay here again.', 'We LOVED Chamberlain’s apartment, couldn’t have asked for anything better. Cozy, super comfortable and great location. Highly recommend!', 'The unit itself was as described — very spacious, large bed, very cute decor and furnishings. Chamberlain was very communicative as well. The place smelled great when I walked in, and I was actually very much looking forward to my stay.\nHowever, upon entry, I found 4 baby cockroaches along with one massive one (at least an inch long). The host was understanding and said that it happens this time of year when it rains, and that the property had just been treated. I was surprised to hear this and felt that, if that is the case, it should have been disclosed in the description. Moreover, the baby ones were all still alive. Knowing these things travel, as do their eggs, I opted to cancel and book a hotel, as I didn’t really see much of another option.\nThe host was respectful and helpful. I would maybe just advise looking into having the drains or door/window areas fully sealed if this is an indeed a common issue.', 'such a fantastic place. I will go there again!', 'My boyfriend and I stayed here for 4 nights. Everything was clean, the place was stocked with all essentials (garbage bags, towels, extra linens) and even had a laundry in-unit with detergent. Location was lovely!

The apartment is next door to the trash shoot, so you can hear whenever someone is in there throwing trash away. Also, this is me being picky, but I did not like the lighting in the bathroom just for the simple fact that I couldn’t do my makeup in that type of lighting (again, just me being picky). I’d also recommend adding a key ring to the key fob so that you can hook it to your car keys. I was always having to search my pocketbook for it because it’s so small.

The style of decor in this home is fun and trendy, well thought out, and matches the photos. The cool magazines under the TV were nice to have and flip through!

The distance to NODA is walkable (a longer walk, but not unreasonable), and there is convenient access to the light rail, which will get you to NODA and beyond. We did not have a car, and I didn't feel like we needed one. I appreciated the stocked Keurig and granola when I was running late in the morning. There is also good coffee, beer, a distillery, and a noodle house within walking distance. The neighborhood is quiet, and the home has a small bonus room in the back that works well for Zoom calls.

We appreciated the sound machines in the bedrooms, as I am a very light sleeper.

It's located in a quiet little neighborhood a very short walk under the bridge to the Light Rail which can then be ridden to several areas of Charlotte (the closest being NoDa).

The next day, I expressed concerns about the bathroom having hair all over the floor and asked for it to be vacuumed in a message, however he did not respond and never addressed it. Other than that, it was a decent place to crash just to sleep. Kitchen supplies were bare minimum. It’s not a place I’d want to hang out if I had lots of down time.

However, this is a shower and sink that has a sliding door between the toilet and additional sink (what I consider ONE very large full bathroom). Ranin said that it matches the photos and Airbnb’s qualifications, so I guess it is partly my responsibility to comb through all the photos. It was my mistake to assume, but this is definitely not what I expected when I booked, and I would have not booked this place if I knew. Additionally, this place has limited tables like night stands, end tables, or coffee tables. It just felt inconvenient because you were putting drinks and phones on the ground. Lastly, the shared pool is only 3.5 feet deep.\nSome advantages of the place is that there is a coffee shop and pizzeria within 2 blocks which was very convenient for breakfast or a snack.

Thanks Jack and friends!!! ❤️❤️❤️', 'Unfortunately, the power was out when I arrived due to a storm. It would have been nice to have been notified of the power outages prior to arriving. When I messaged the host about when the power would be up running, I was told the technicians were working on it. Fortunately, I did not have to wait very long until the power was back on in the apartment, however, I couldn’t use the elevator until the next day which was an inconvenience since I had a lot of belongings.

4.94",50,Superhost,4 years hosting,,"['This is a small space with lots of room for your things. I loved how empty shelves and baskets were provided. Cabinets in the kitchen were empty and a small landing zone next to the front door was open for all of MY things! My dog is super clingy, so having one space was perfect for him to relax and not have to follow me. I could have made room for workouts if I pushed the couch aside, but there was so much room in the private and fenced yard, I blasted my music and worked outside.\nSingle ladies: I felt very safe and looked out for here. The neighborhood was safe and quiet at night. I had no worries walking my dog any time of day or night. I was also included in neighborhood get togethers and introduced to all the neighbors. All super nice people. They would wave and stop to chat while I was out on walks.\nThere’s a farmers market 5 minutes down the road and nice places to eat close by. We’ll definitely return to this exact spot on our next visit to NC.', 'I absolutely loved staying at Andrea’s place. It was perfect for what I was looking for.

Our dog loved the fenced-in area and also made some new friends in the neighborhood!\nAndrea is the best when it comes to hosting. She gave us ideas on things to do and places to go. Since our visit was a house-hunting trip, she made a point to introduce us to people in the neighborhood, who are all extremely nice. She also introduced us to our Realtor, which ultimately led us to finding a lot and building a home.\nWe would highly recommend Andrea's cottage to any couple looking for a cozy and private place to stay near the lake.

The cottage is similar to a 1 room studio with bed tv and kitchen all in one space and the bathroom separated with a sliding door. It was perfect for my mom. You are right across from the lake and can enjoy some amazing morning/evening views and walks. Bring some bug spray and sunblock as the mosquitos and sun can be brutal.\nYou are 10 minutes from everything you need. You have Publix grocery store as the closest but a Walmart not far away. I found Hope Park less then 10 minutes away that allowed for my daughter to enjoy a park with a water pad all free. Behind the park was a Fresh produce market. I have a kayak and innertubes that I brought on our last day and was able to float and navigate the channel.

Our dogs love playing in the lake. The bonus this trip was the surprise 30amp RV connection!! We had our 37 foot class A and both work remote. Having an extra place to work with AC for the week was so helpful!! Talk to Andrea about electricity costs to plug in. It’ll be worth it. The drive in to her neighborhood has a few spots with lower branches on one side of the street but you can avoid by going around. The gravel drive is wide enough to accommodate slides and long enough to put a car behind (and maybe alongside). It is sloped a bit but we managed. Large trees on one side keep it shaded.\nPlenty of restaurants and stores all within 5-10 min drive. We love Eddie’s outdoor bar and the people there are always nice.\nRent a pontoon from Jeff and be sure to go up to Toucans or Blue Parrot.', 'When we arrived the cottage was very clean and ready for us.

Hoping it’s available for our next visit!!', 'My husband and I stayed one night in Charlotte for an event, and this was a great place to stay while here! It’s close to the city and is in a well-kept, quiet area outside of the city. The nice patio with table and chairs for sitting made the stay even more relaxing.

We felt really well in the flat, thank you :)', 'We didn’t use the light rail like we had planned because it was so cold but it was still an easy Uber ride downtown for a show after we drove down from Chapel Hill.

The flat is brilliant and feels like home.', 'Fairly new to AB&B, our 3rd stay. The best yet.

Did not disappoint - I recommend ☺️🌻', 'This location was very neat and peaceful. Very much enjoyed my stay. Highly recommended.', 'This was a great deal for the area. We loved admiring the neighborhood and our stay was comfortable. We enjoyed playing cards on the basement deck. There were other guests staying upstairs, but it still felt private.', ""The apartment is in a very quiet residential area. You can park your car in front of the house and get to the basement via a path. The apartment is well equipped with everything, everything works perfectly, the decor is tasteful and practical.

Even under the bed and couch was clean which seems to get missed at a lot of other places. We enjoyed the local food and drink establishments as well as the Charlotte disc golf scene. Will definitely check for this place for future trips to Charlotte.', 'Good location near the city center. Our stay was great!', 'Enjoyed our stay. Though the fastest walk to the light rail was closed due to construction, it wasn’t too much further going around. Loves the neighborhood and how close you are to downtown but still feels like your in a true neighborhood. We enjoyed a walk around every morning with our 12mo through the neighborhoods looking at all the new houses. Super easy to get to spectrum stadium for the concert we were in town for too. The only slight negative was there was a mix up with their cleaning service and it hasn’t been cleaned when we arrived, they got someone out there fairly quickly so ended up just going out to get dinner while it got cleaned. Great stay overall and would likely stay there again if we come back to Charlotte.', 'Thank you for a great experience! The airbnb was clean and the kitchen had everything we needed. The patio area was so calming and relaxing. We loved listening to the birds and watching the trees. Great stay!', 'The high points for us were:\n- the apartment was very clean, well decorated, and cozy\n- the chalkboards and chalkboard stickers identifying where things were/little notes were adorable\n- the full kitchen was amazing (love the gas stove)\nI would caution anyone traveling with school age or older children - the couple upstairs can be heard pretty clearly through the floor (if you catch my drift). They woke me up at 5am our first morning, unintentionally - thankfully my 12yo (who they knew was traveling with) slept through it.\nThere also seems to be an issue with them cooking upstairs and setting off the fire alarm (both Saturday and Sunday that we stayed).\nI recommend better soundproofing if the apartment is going to be used during the owners’ private time. I also recommend either supplying 2-ply toilet paper (or advising guests to bring their own).\nThe stay was ok. It was convenient to the location we needed. Probably won’t stay again, though.', 'Brian and Erica’s place was the perfect spot for our weekend visiting Charlotte. It is clean, comfortable, and decorated so nicely! Having coffee in the morning on the patio was definitely a highlight of the stay. It’s so close to many restaurants and breweries. We would definitely stay here again!', 'We were grateful to have found this place last minute. We had to fly in from Hawaii for a funeral, so our sleep schedule was a bit off. The place was clean and quiet, with a dedicated workspace - exactly what needed. Hosts were helpful and responsive. We would stay here again!', 'We enjoyed our stay. The hilly path to the basement apartment is somewhat steep. The construction happening nearby and overhead noise when people were home were louder than we thought it would be.

They have a great place and it was very clean and inviting! Perfect for our getaway for the concert we went to. Thank you for a great stay!', 'Great location!!! Great place!!!', 'The place was just as pictured! Lots of space & cozy! The walk to the blue line station is about 10-12 mins and not the most pedestrian friendly due to a lot of new construction and a busy road, but we didn’t really mind considering the proximity to the line! This home is on the edge of a really cute neighborhood where we walked around in the mornings. The space was clean & the hosts were very responsive, we really enjoyed our stay!', 'Lovely place with everything you could need and all is clearly labeled so that finding things is easy. Cute decor, comfortable bed. I had a little trouble adjusting the thermostat, but that was all!', 'The place was nice and spacious. Plenty of room to stretch out and relax. It was also private. I did not hear anything during my stay and had no interactions with the hosts. The bed was basic and the springs seemed to be aging. The place could use a dusting and light paint job in some of the areas that get scuffed up by use. My major issue was with the bathroom. The shower curtain and lip between the shower and floor were pink with mildew. The baseboard outside the shower was black with mold/mildew from constant contact with water escaping the shower. I provided this feedback to the hosts via message but they did not respond.', 'Absolutely beautiful place!! Would 100% stay again. Great location!!', 'Brian and Erica’s place was excactly as described. Very peaceful, and close to restaurants. Uptown Charlotte was only 15 minutes away.', 'Brian and Erica’s place was lovely.

That said, it still felt private.\nInterior was lovely and I loved all the attention to detail and clear instructions.\n\nSuper convenient to South Blvd and Uptown.', ""Very nice stay in Charlotte 2 nights for a concert. Utilized the nearby light rail service to skip the driving and parking downtown. Brian and Erica's place was quiet, comfortable, private, well appointed with everything I needed to feel safe and comfortable. Perfect for 1 or 2 people."", ""Brian and Erica's place was clean, comfortable and tidy, and matched their description exactly. The bathroom was very clean and there was plenty of hot water for showers. My husband and I really loved having the full kitchen, since I have food allergies and can't eat out very easily. The bed was a little too soft for us, but this was a preference, not a problem. And with a lot of ongoing construction nearby, it was noisy during the day, but quieted down around 6 pm and, since we were out all day, this was not a problem.

From the basics like lots of extra ‘necessities’ and quality products to age appropriate children’s toys and games to (nice!) paddle boards for guests use. There was even a wonderful welcome gift. Gorgeous touches that we really appreciated.\nWe equally appreciated the support the hosts provided during our stay during a power outage. They went above and beyond to over communicate both with us and the energy provider. Made us feel incredibly well taken care of.\nWe couldn’t recommend this home or these hosts enough!

Theres is also a greenway for walking right across the street, which was wonderful as we had brought our dog. The hot tub and fenced in backyard were a perfect way to unwind from the day’s activities. The house was clean and easy to find. I will say, for a place that is dog-friendly, they did have a lot of glass pieces that were at dog level. We spent a good bit of our arrival moving their decorations and fragile pieces to wear a dog’s tail or body wouldn’t accidentally break them. There were also very little kitchen items. We had to go out and buy aluminum foil and pot holders as there were none there for us to use, which we don’t normally need to buy when we stay at other airbnbs.', 'Great communication from host, clean house, and great location.', 'we had a great stay!

First I will say that Victor was prompt with response and I appreciated the immediacy that he solved my issue. Jesus, I think could use some customer service training. The home is pet friendly which was convenient since I had my dog with me. However there was an odor in the home and stains on the sofa that made it apparent other occupants don’t treat this location as if it were their own. It also seems the cleaning that is done is not sufficient to offset that or up to par with an $80 pet fee. Victor said this was the first time they received this feedback so it is possible this is the result of the previous guest.There was also a window that was open and I could not close it. I left early for these reasons and another unrelated reason but Victor stepped in and accepted my request for a refund for the night I did not stay and the pet fee. Aside from this, the fenced yard and location in CLT were great', ""I don't know if I can blame Victor or Jesus,the other person representing property.\nIn one word this was a DISSAPOINTMENT.

I took a picture of the strip with box and sent to Victor asking if someone can come add proper chemicals to the water. He said he doesn’t trust those strips and then he said he can have someone drain water and add new water. Later that night we were going to bed and there were mouse droppings in the bed.

I was very distressed by the neighbor's nosiness about the property. While enjoying the hot tub and the beautiful backyard I was interrupted numerous times by neighbors coming to the fence.

It was worth what we paid.\nGood things: Easy to get to, right next to the greenway, quiet. What we paid was SUPER affordable compared to other options out there, and we were able to bring our small dog.\nThings to know before you stay: It\'s an old home with a superficial remodel. It doesn\'t smell bad, and it\'s not dirty; but it smells like an old home dowsed in cleaner. I was a little disappointed that the hot tub doesn\'t actually get up to heat, but Victor responded quickly and probably had someone come look at it. Judging by the way the back panel was removed from the hot tub, it\'s a known issue that probably doesn\'t bother most people. The last thing to know is that there are some added fees.

However we had multiple minor issues during our short stay- which were promptly addressed by the host however we probably wouldn’t stay here again.\nWhen we checked in, there is a side lot entrance confusing to get to if it’s your first time so we lugged our luggage up a mile long staircase to get inside. Upon arrival, the Airbnb failed to have basic amenities like paper towel and a toaster, but we messaged the host and she dropped off a toaster.\nThe stay was fine however there were a few minor issues. The smoke detector started beeping and figured it needed batteries replaced. Host took care of the issue later but wrong batteries so it was ripped out of wall.\nOur last night was very strange/ scary. The host unfortunately had guests that were loudly fighting and playing loud music. Messaged host about it and noise stopped. Overall would skip on this place in the future as there are other airbnbs in the area.', 'The spot was very clean and in a quiet neighborhood.', 'Loved this place! Convenient distance from everything, and our host was very responsive any time there was a question.

Very walkable', 'This was a very nice, clean, and enjoyable place to stay!', ""This is a great place in the South End just off the beaten path, and near an intersection that seems to have little automobile traffic most of the time, so it's easy to cross the street. It's a quiet place and a short walk to a host of restaurants and transit. While I was there I relied 100% on walking/transit, so I'm unable to comment on the parking out back.\nChamberlain was a great host! Very responsive and really cared about making the place feel like a home away from home. Thanks! :-)"", 'I have been in Charlotte every week since February 2023 in between the renaissance south park hotel I stayed in along with about a dozen other Airbnbs, I think this one was my favorite.

Would recommend', ""Chamberlin was responsive to all of my messages and made sure to provide a solid welcome.\nHe took the time to reach out and let me know things about the place and made for a great host.\nI wanted to share a quick story to highlight the kind of host Chamberlin is. I accidentally left my electric toothbrush at the house. I sent a message to Chamberlin asking if I could go back to the house to retrieve it.\nHe responded back quickly and told me I was welcome to go check for it.\nIn the meantime, he was meeting with maintenance at the house. Not only did he find it, but he took the time to wrap it in a paper towel and place it on the front porch for me.\nThis kind of customer care and respect isn't common and it went a long way toward helping me finish my stay happily and comfortably.\nChamberlin was a great host and I will be looking up his places again the next time I'm in CLT."", 'The location was perfect and walkable; the unit was exactly as described in the listing. Tastefully decorated and comfortable.', 'My stay was amazing loved the place !', 'Super convenient to walk to south end.', ""love the location. We walked to restaurants for every meal. This part of the city has been revitalized into a special community.\nThe communication with the host was easy and always responsive. The condo was exactly as described. Checking in and out was simple. The key was easy to access.\nThey have a large parking area behind the building accessed from a different street and the spaces are not really clearly defined. The parking was secluded but safe and monitored by cameras as well as well lit by lovely strings of lights. While unusual the parking isn't that big of a deal unless you were trying to find it for the first time in the dark.\nThe furniture is really good quality and super comfortable. The sheets were noticeably clean and the closet space was superb."", 'Great location and place. Super spacious and felt like home!', 'My family needed to be in Charlotte for a number of days while my dog underwent cancer treatment in the area. We were scrambling to find a clean, comfortable place due to the limited number of AirBNB that permit animals, even with service dogs. After explaining the situation to Chamberlain, we were granted permission to stay and we are so thankful! Everything was clean as can be, a great walkable area, safe neighborhood, good wifi for working remotely, and ample parking on the street if needed. My husband even wanted to stay longer because Chamberlain’s place has a massive TV with allll the channels!\nThank you so much and we will be back if in the area!', 'Our stay at the Chamberlain\'s place over the holidays was absolutely phenomenal!!! I would recommend it and we most definitely will keep this residence as a ""5 Star Standard"" other location would have to live up to.

Metcalf', 'I really enjoyed my stay. The house was perfect, private backyard nice front porch. Walkable to a store. I would definitely stay again.', 'This apartment was sufficient for our stay, but it was somewhat bare-bones:\nThere was no shower head in the shower, just a pipe spraying water, so it felt like water was being pelted at us\nThere was no toilet paper, so we had to supply our own\nThere was only one extra blanket\nWe were also sent a link at checkout asking us to pay for using household items, such as soaps and even for the wall decor. I’m not sure what that was about, but it seemed inappropriate, especially given the fact that toilet paper was not provided.\nOverall, it was fine for our time in Charlotte, as we were mainly looking for a place to lay our heads, but it wouldn’t stay again. I’d recommend the hotel across the street, which is the same price.', 'Great spot in Charlotte, walkable area and centrally located.', 'This is our go-to place to stay when visiting Charlotte.

Second time staying & I think this will be our place we stay each visit to Charlotte! Walkable and short drive to anywhere you want to go in the city!', 'Furniture is comfortable and the private driveway is nice and out of the street. My only complaint is the lock and key. We were locked out from 1230am until almost 9 am with both our phones inside of the listing. Using a gas station phone to communicate with someone at home who had access to my computer. The host never reached out or offered us help to get back in other than “breaking in with a clothes hanger”.

Walking distance to everything restaurant, bar, coffee shop and grocery store Southend has to offer!', 'While spacious, there much left to be desired in terms of warmth and comfort. The interior felt barren and unwelcoming, lacking any distinctive features or homely touches that might have made the stay more enjoyable. A notable inconvenience was the missing TV remote in the living room, rendering the television unusable and diminishing the overall entertainment options. Additionally, the noise from the occupants above, particularly their late-night movements at 2 AM, further detracted from the peacefulness of the experience.\nConsidering the cost of the stay, I found it to be poor value for money, especially when compared to a nearby hotel that promised a more inviting atmosphere at a similar or lower price point. In hindsight, exploring other accommodation options would likely have offered better value.', 'Exactly as shown in the pictures. Easy check in. Good location. Very pretty place. Overall had a great stay.', 'Was a pleasure', 'Loved our stay there for my Scentsy Family reunion at the convention center! Loved being able to do laundry! Comfy bed!

We enjoyed our stay.', 'The place was exactly what we needed for a weekend in Charlotte. It was close enough to walk to most of the restaurants we wanted to try.

It was my first time in North Carolina, and Chamberlain made me feel welcomed and comfortable in this clean, cozy space. Very responsive and friendly host.

I’d stay here again.', 'Only complaints are that the place lacked blankets (no blankets in the closet as stated in the description) and lighting. Bedroom and living area have no ceiling lighting, and lamps only turn on if the wall switch is flipped on, which we did not figure out until day 3 of our trip.\nThe location is fantastic! 5 min walk to CATS and bus stops, with lots of walkable bars, restaurants, and cafes. 5 min on CATS to uptown.

In great proximity to all that south end has to offer.

I had my fingers crossed that we would get to stay in this beautiful house. I booked it in the middle of the night and it was approved by the afternoon. We didn’t want to leave!

There was rotting food all throughout the dishwasher. I have this documented in photos. We attempted to contact Maria again to let her know about the rotting food and sent her the photos. We told her that we were willing to clean it but that we requested a partial refund for the night per AirBnB's cleanliness policy. She refused. She also would not send anyone to fix the issues.

It was perfect for a one night stay to go to a concert nearby. The couch is cute but really not comfortable and it could use curtains in the bedroom to keep out more light. Also has a 120$ cleaning fee and you have to put the trash out back, load dishes, and load your linens/actually start the laundry machine.

It was easy to get to from the airport and was a short drive from restaurants and walkable areas (like Davidson). We were in town for a wedding and at our meals out, so we did fully utilize the kitchen. But there were plenty of kitchen amenities if we needed them. The beds were comfortable and there was plenty of room for 3 of us. In the master bedroom, there is no door to the bathroom. It wasn’t an issue for us, just something to be aware of depending on who you’re traveling with.', 'This is one of those places that looks more put together in the photos than it really is. A few things for your consideration - the front bedroom has no bathroom door, just a makeshift shower curtain (not ideal); the back bedroom’s bed frame consistently fell apart each night, so we tried to put it back together the best we could; we couldn’t get the tv to work for a long time when we first arrived because there are multiple remotes & no instructions left for which remote does what; finally - ants in the kitchen! Everywhere! The host claimed that they’d just had pest control out. While it could’ve been true, this was definitely a miserable experience as we constantly worked to kill them everyday & keep all our food hidden away in the fridge. Overall, our experience was just ok. Not sure I’d stay here again but Maria was very kind & we absolutely LOVED the neighborhood & location! It’s a shame because the home could be lovely if more care & time went into making it that way.', 'This was such a cute place to stay! Very quiet neighborhood. Easy access. Very spacious. Will definitely stay again!', 'Maria was a lovely host. Her home is beautiful, welcoming, like home, very clean and neat. First off I noticed the neighborhood is very quiet, quaint and safe. The neighbors I met who were out walking their dogs were very nice and friendly also. Maria left a nice warm and welcoming note with candies on the counter which was a very nice and surprising touch. Maria was very approachable, prompt, responsive and kind when I sent her questions about the home etc.\nMy friend and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend Maria’s home without hesitation. If I am in the area again I would stay there again if her home was available.', ""I loved this space. I felt right at home from the moment I walked in. Parking was easy and there was always a space across the street. Neighbors are friendly, neighborhood is quiet and private and it's so peaceful. Love the BBQ grill out in the backyard. The master has a big tub and the bed is so comfy. I need to plan another trip so that I can stay here again! Great host!!"", 'Enjoyed our stay. Quiet and walkable access to food. Located in my daughter’s neighborhood. Ideal for visiting the Huntersville area. Street parking was not an issue. Had everything we needed for our 5 day stay.

Very clear instructions on parking and how to get in to the townhouse which was very helpful.', 'We really enjoyed the stay. It was extremely convenient to where we wanted to be.

There wasn't a single thing we needed that wasn't there.\nWhenever I had a question - both leading up to our stay and while there - their responses were prompt, helpful, courteous and accommodating.\nThe location is convenient to all the essentials you might need but feels away from it all.

It is the perfect spot for a family vacation, a birthday weekend getaway, a tranquil retreat, or even a business trip with a view (although the wifi is limited). Aesthetically, it is beautiful; fancy yet rustic, and fitting for the lake, but also cozy. We felt at home! The first night in the home, we ordered pizza from Enrico's (a suggestions by the hosts), and we found it delicious. We were able to catch one of those sunsets! The next day, we made all our meals in the home, but we did rent a pontoon from Lake Wylie boat rental in Belmont, NC (it's a family owned business). The last day, we spent more time floating in the water, then stopped for dinner at Papa Doc's (lake side bar) before going home to bonfire and make s'mores. We could not have imagined a more perfect getaway weekend. We did leave some suggestions for the hosts and within the next hour after checking out, David & Lacey responded with updates. They took all our suggestions to heart, and it made us all the more excited to return again some day!"", 'Very lovely home. Beautiful lake views as described.', 'The house and property was amazing.

We had rain a couple of evenings during our stay so only used it once but watching the rain from the covered patio and gorgeous sitting room was perfect too!

All at a very reasonable price.\nIt rained most of the time we were there, but the house is so comfortable and lovely, it didn’t matter at all.

The view of the lake is one of the best we saw after renting a pontoon boat and touring around. David and Lacey have thought of everything to make your stay comfortable. We’ve stayed at several rental properties and it was so nice to not have to buy trash bags, dishwasher detergent, hand soap, etc. We travelled with our 2 children who loved swimming in the lake and roasting marshmallows at night. We had a couple visit us for 3 nights and they really enjoyed the privacy of the apartment. The sunsets were breathtaking and the outdoor seating options were endless. The location was very quiet and relaxing. We rented paddle boards and used David and Lacey’s kayaks. The new dock is going to be great.', 'The pictures do not do this home justice! It is amazing!

Quiet, private and serene were the thoughts I had when we pulled into the driveway. From the moment we walked in ... we knew we would get the rest and comfort we needed. There are beautiful appointments in every space. The view ... amazing. We found ourselves drinking coffee in the morning just watching the scene of the lake waking up with all its ducks flying in and fisherman quietly floating - just waiting for a fish to bite. Sunsets, glorious. Bed was so comfortable, throws on the chairs in the 3 lounging areas made it so cozy. Kitchen had everything we needed to feel at home. We spent our days shopping for furniture in CLT and High Point, as we are also building a lake house ready in May. I can't tell you how nice it was to stay here.

I’m from California an it was a great escape.\nWithout a doubt, I will be staying here again next year!!', 'Beautiful home with AMAZING views of Lake Wylie!! We brought a blow-up paddle board and huge raft for us to hang out on the lake. Enjoyed a hike at McDowell Nature Preserve one morning and did a little bowling at the Bowl n’ Bounce.

Great communication with the property Manager. I definitely would come back.', 'If you’re looking for a private, waterfront escape, look no further! The Luray Lakehouse was beautiful and the photos do not do it justice! The open floor plan layout was perfect for my large family. There was ton of dining and living spaces and although it’s a lakefront property, the home had a really cozy cabin feel which would make it a great winter escape as well. There were a ton of books, magazines, board games, and TVs which was really enjoyable for the indoorsy type like myself or for those looking for more adventurous things to do, there were paddle boards, rowing boats, cornhole boards, and a beautiful outdoor dining area, perfect for grilling.

The dock was wonderful to go catch some sun and when we got too hot, there’s also shade there. I can’t say enough about this place. Don’t hesitate.', 'David and team made our stay very enjoyable! We really appreciated the good communication; easy to get ahold of when necessary. It is an amazing house on an equally impressive property. Seems like the cove attracts a fair share of wildlife as well There we’re a couple of palmetto bugs that found their way into the house, but given the attention to detail the team gives the place we expect this will be resolved. In any case, this was minor. The fact is that most of the wildlife is quite welcome, including a heron that sunned itself daily on the parked boat nearby and a pair of raptors that were quite entertaining as they soared over the dock, catching the occasional fish (which is more than we caught!). But the grill and relaxing outside dinner area made up for our lack of fishing acumen. A great stay!', ""Impress your senses at this beautiful and lovingly furnished and decorated home on the lake.

It certainly made our trip much easier.', 'This was the best rental we have ever stayed in! The kitchen was well equipped and the furnishings were cozy and felt like home. The outdoor seating areas were plentiful and many meals were enjoyed at the outdoor dining table. The fire pit is impressive and provided the perfect evening R&R spot once the kids went to bed. The open floor plan and the little touches like night lights made it also family friendly for our young kids. The sunrises and sunsets were incredible! The location was perfect as you are tucked into a small cove but have expansive views.

Cute neighborhood with beautiful gardens. Biking paths everywhere.', 'This place was perfect!', 'Pretty disappointed after all the good reviews. The place needs some work. It is done in the cheapest way possible with weird rules. We were scared to use the towels because of the worry of messing them up and then being charged towel fees. They act like the towels are Egyptian cotton when they were only $1 room essential towels from Target. If they are worried about stains or the potential of their white towels getting dirty they shouldn’t buy white towels or maybe use bleach to clean. Concerned about their cleaning habits because ironically the towel they left us had makeup on it. Not stained… I wiped it off with my finger and it was fresh. Barely anywhere to put clothes if you are there more than 3 days it would be tough. They should add a dresser in the bedroom and maybe a tv the bedroom is bland and cheap - worst pillows in my life. Also gave us a single roll of toilet paper for a 4 day stay. Everything just done as cheap as possible and they ignored my messages during my stay!', 'I feel largely catfished by the pictures.

We loved the bathroom and also wish I had a door. The coffee on the machine is very poor quality(it doesn't know anything) , if you love coffee as my family tries to bring yours. And finally Ranin was flexible with the entrance and let us in 2 hours before we valued that a lot since we were with two girls🤍\nThe last thing we wrote to ask about the body soap and we never had an answer, just answered us to give check-out instructions, when we left at 10am they knocked on the door to do cleaning, being the check out at 11am but the lady was super friendly and waited until 11am.

Felt kinda like putting cheap oil in a Ferrari.\n- The hair dryer doesn't work very well.\n- Checkout at 10am is a bit early when most places ask for checkout at 11am.

Very clean and very comfortable beds.\nRanin was very responsive and nice! The key broke inside the lock and he came within 15 mins to fix the problem.\nTips for those who stay here:\nStairs can be dangerous for small babies/toddlers and there are no gates available. We did use the ironing board as a “gate” and it helped somewhat.\nIf you are used to ceiling fans or floor fans like we are, there are none in the lower rooms. Bring your own.\nOverall very nice place!', 'Highly recommend, very well stocked with everything that you need. When back in town we will definitely try and stay here if available!

It was just perfect for our girls trip! if we come again, we'll stay longer!!\nJust a note: there is no bedroom or shower on the main floor, and you have to climb a spiral staircase to get both upstairs and downstairs. The stairs were a little difficult for my mom, and it could be difficult for small children."", 'We were very happy with our stay. The home was immaculate and welcoming and just as pictured. Ranin thought of everything. There were two cozy sitting areas with comfy throws to snuggle up in. Very nice mattresses, plenty of felt hangers in the closets and a generous supply of clean towels. Excellent lighting options with numerous lamps or overhead lighting when needed. A large full length mirror which we appreciated when getting ready for the wedding we were attending. The kitchen had everything we needed to be able to prepare food. She had included seasonal fall decor which added to the warm and homey atmosphere. If we’d had time we would have loved to use the fire pit that was loaded with logs ready to use. We would definitely like to stay here again if we come back to the area.', 'Peaceful and charming, would highly recommend!', 'Cozy and beautiful place! Highly recommended.', 'House is great!

The house was very clean and had everything we needed for our stay.', 'Super cute house and very well stocked', 'This bnb is a super cute spot. I stayed here with my girls for my wedding weekend! It looks like something out of a story book when you drive in. The only down side in my opinion is the spiral staircase to the upstairs is VERY narrow so it made it very difficult to get luggage up and down and even to just access the loft in general. But once you’re up there it is very cozy! Would still highly recommend this spot!', 'Very nice place and great host', 'Lovely stay and Christmas decorations was a nice bonus!', 'Very clean beautiful place, the pictures don’t do it enough justice.

There is everything we need.', 'This was an awesome stay!', ""We LOVED out stay at the A-frame. It was perfect for all 3 generations of our family.

The house was clean, quiet and comfortable. Nice linens.The host was very generous with\nthe breakfast/coffee extras.', ""Lovely rental. Would recommend and stay again. We were in town for a funeral and just for an overnight, it was wonderful to have a home to return to, rather than a hotel. I wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the space. We felt safe, comfortable, and like we were guests in a well-appointed home. The kitchen is small but filled with everything you would need to cook and enjoy meals. There's tons of coffee and tea options, filtered water, and some cooking supplies--oil, seasoning, etc. There is a big dining table, and 2 living areas! The beds are extremely comfortable and we all slept well, 3 of us, using the 3 bedrooms (one is a loft, but feels private). Also, the shower has bathing supplies. Ranin reached out a couple times with information and to check in. This experience ranks high for Airbnb."", 'This place is excellent. Our family of 4 stayed here while passing through town and found ourselves wishing we were sticking around for a couple of days. Plenty of trees. Beautiful lot. Close to the city/highway, but far enough out to feel like you’re in the forest. We loved the layout. The spiral staircase was a challenge for our youngest, but he figured it out. Everyone had plenty of room.\nI can’t say enough about how cool the lot is. We drive through Charlotte every year and this will certainly be our first choice in the future. A very cool place.', 'I hope to come again and will definitely book this storybook home again for a stay. I wish I was in town longer to enjoy the tranquility a bit longer. Just be prepared for the spiral stairs that only add to the charm! Thank you, Ranin for sharing this beautiful spot!', 'This was the perfect accommodation for our girls weekend! The kitchen was well stocked with everything that we needed. The bedrooms were comfortable and clean, with plenty of space for all of us. The downstairs sitting room is so cozy, it was the perfect place for us to lounge and spend a rainy afternoon when the weather would not cooperate! As we left, we agreed that this was definitely worth repeating. We will be back!', 'my girl and I wanted a getaway from the city with our pup and this place was just perfect. this home was the definition of quaint and homey. beautiful design, the interior was amazing, the outside areas were beautifully serene it was a whole vibe. we were there a week the only bad thing was having to leave we wanted to stay longer, really felt like home. the host was amazing and responsive truly the whole experience was a 10 out of 5 stars.', 'Our stay was amazing, the host was very responsive and helpful!', 'Thank you so so much for letting us stay at your place. Absolutely incredible place. We had a wonderful time.', 'This cabin was charming and affordable! The fire pit was fun, and Ranin really went above and beyond to provide all that we needed for a fun and relaxing stay. The coffee offerings and waffle bar were great. The house was really cute and different. The only note I have is that the only indoor access to the upstairs or basement is by a very steep and narrow carpeted spiral staircase that is not mentioned in the description or pictured prominently in any of the photos. I had two different kids fall down the stairs and generally found it very difficult to carry things up and down. For this reason I don’t think it’s a great location for babies, toddlers, or young kids. But we did have a ball playing Monopoly!', 'This place was the perfect quiet getaway. The house was clean and stocked with toilet paper, dish detergent, hand soap, clothing detergent, shampoo, body wash and breakfast, which is pretty much unheard of in an airbnb. The wooded area and treehouse style house was super unique and we loved the style. Our host was super responsive & friendly. We loved our stay!', 'Very cozy and fun stay with friends!', 'At first sight the home was beautiful, just like photos. Inside the home was very clean and welcoming. Coffee and waffle breakfast that was available was just a small bonus. I would definitely recommend.', 'This place was amazing!!!!! I would absolutely rent it again when I come back to visit family. 6 of us and a dog were incredibly comfortable and loved the entire house. It’s so peaceful and private. We fully enjoyed the fire pit and front porch space. Everything you need is there, and then some! We went for a walk down the gravel road and it was lovely! It truly was the best air bnb I’ve ever booked!', 'Adorable and cozy!', 'Great place! The kids loved it. Thought they were in a giant tent!', 'Great place was clean safe area but would not recommend for toddlers due to the spiral staircase over and although it was a great day', 'Great stay.

Amazing having the waffles in the morning for the kids! Would def and hopefully stay again!', 'Nice place', 'My family and I loved staying at Ranin’s A Frame! The house is perfect. Everything you see in pictures is better in person. The decor and little touches everywhere make this stay worry free. You had me at teacups and a lovely tea variety and my kids loved the Nutella pyramid for the waffles (or just to snack on — IYKYK!)\nThere are two separate areas to lounge.\nThe beds are beyond comfortable. The linens are soft. The kitchen has everything!\nLastly, the trees create a private paradise that is still close to restaurants.\nRanin is communicative and check in and out were easy!\nThank you again!

The architecture allows for an open airy cabin. The extra kitchen amenities were a nice touch. Definitely recommend!"", 'Ranin was informative, helpful, and quick to respond throughout.

Beautiful home and surroundings!', 'Truthfully a wonderful experience! The Airbnb was beyond clean and spotless. It was so carefully decorated and included everything needed to feel right at home. The house was very peaceful. Away from busy roads or loud surroundings. It’s located about 30 minutes from downtown Charlotte and has some mountain ranges around 30 minutes away as well.

Plenty of amenities inside made it feel like we were home. Firepit worked great and we immediately wished we had more time to stay.', 'This home is a very special place.

A gem of a place!', ""Beautiful spot, great for entertaining! We had a nice night with family over inside and BBQing.\nPro tip- load in for the lower level from the back door. much easier to get your bags in than down the spiral staircase.\nThey have everything you'll need for your stay- great kitchen utensils and appliances and a really nice space."", 'This is a great AirBnB for a group of friends or family gathering that wants to hang out more than a couple of days. We stayed one night with an infant and wish we could stay longer. It’s private, cozy and fun. Love the place! Highly recommended!', 'We were in town for a big soccer event close to Charlotte and this house was great to stay at as it’s in the middle of a few locations.

We were very pleased with the amenities as well as the Nutella and Breakfast set up in the kitchen. We are so happy with our stay and hope to visit again soon!', 'Ranin was polite and the place was perfect. It felt larger than the pictures make it seem. The spiral stairs can take a bit to get used to and may be a bit difficult for larger individuals to use as it feels a bit tight. But worked perfectly for us! Dog friendly as well which was a big + with plenty of outdoor space and trees to tether your dog if need be. The bedrooms and restrooms were very clean. The place was stocked with just about everything you would need. Definitely recommend and will be returning.', 'Super cute, well-appointed home in the woods. It was perfect for our occasion — a low-key sleepover with BFFs to celebrate my daughter’s 17th birthday. Loved the provided breakfast options. The beds were amazingly comfortable.\nOne thing to note is that the bedrooms are accessible via a narrow spiral staircase — or from the outside through the basement sliding glass door. This wasn’t an issue at all for our party, but anyone with mobility challenges should be aware.\nRanin was very easy to communicate with and we felt confident during our entire stay. Strongly recommend and would book here again!', 'We had a great stay! The house was clean and the beds were very comfortable.

Also really appreciated the breakfast foods and coffee that was available.', ""We had a great time at this A frame house.\nWe didn't get to use the outside fire pit and chairs because it rained every evening, but it was very nice looking and we would have had a nice relaxing time outside had the weather cooperated.\nThe furniture was comfortable as were the beds. We loved the beds! The only downfall is there is only one shower/bath and it's in the basement. Although the kitchen is small it does have a lot of storage and was easy to use by the way it's designed.\nIt is in a very quiet neighborhood.\nOverall, we had a great time staying here and our host gave us all the information we needed and responded quickly when we had a question."", 'The pictures on the site were great but they just don’t do the place justice.

Checking in/out was a breeze thanks to him.\nIf you see the photos, know it's even more beautiful than the pictures described. We were amazed with the lower level and how well every inch of the place was utilized. Extremely clean and very well decorated. Amazing views especially from the loft bedroom. Gorgeous place.\nHome was in a perfect location close to the city without the city noise/traffic. Great place to relax after a day in the big city. Close to supermarkets and restaurants. Lots of space to host your family gatherings with ample parking. We had groups outside by the fire pit, in the private downstairs living room, and others in the main living room.\nWorth every dollar and will be our go-to place when we return."", 'For this to be my first Airbnb stay, I enjoyed everything about the home.

Whether it’s a short stay or a long one you will feel right at home.', 'Great stay.', 'Loved this Airbnb and love NODA. The decor, clean, stocked kitchen and the many magazines, books, and information on things to do and places to eat was perfect. Lots of effort to make your stay effortless. I was very impressed and stayed for two weeks. Be aware it is an older house and I worked 3rd shift so sleeping on 1st floor with the floors creaking and guests going up and down the steps was not ideal. The curtains let in a lot of light, which is nice, but not for me sleeping during the day. I sleep through mostly anything and the bed was super comfortable so it was not a big issue. It is a busy street with lots of foot traffic, noise from train and a dog park across the street. Great place to stay for vacation. My body wash, pizza, and beer disappeared! Take everything to your room. This place stays booked. Nevertheless, I enjoyed my stay!', ""We weren't here for long, as it was a road trip pit stop.

Thanks for being so communicative.', ""Great spot couple walkable blocks from downtown NODA. Definitely look for availability here next time I'm in NODA."", 'I want to first praise Lisa’s place. It was well kept, well organized, as described and with an easy access to the train to go uptown.

The house is a special location right in the middle of Noda. Great opportunity to enjoy the neighborhood.', 'The Mercury House was great and just what I needed for a night in NoDa.

Very clean, great location, and comfortable!', ""Great value, extremely responsive host. I'd definitely recommend this stay! Lisa provides everything you need - towels, shampoo, coffee, makeup wipes… I felt right at home and appreciated having a break from hotels. The neighborhood feels safe and I liked that my room had its own keypad lock. The guests I stayed with were on the louder side but there are quiet hours, occasionally during the day you can hear the train go by (I never heard this at night and I’m a light sleeper). I was VERY happy with my stay and check out was super easy (not all airbnbs are like that these days!) Thank you Lisa for the wonderful experience!"", 'Amazing stay in an amazing neighborhood! I walked to breakfast, lunch, dinner, coffee, and yoga. Can’t beat the location, value, and host responsiveness. I’ll be back again!', ""The stay was easy and the hosts were communicative all the way through. My son had one night that his mates were quite noisy dropping him off and they handled it really well which was so appreciated. The hosts also tried to accommodate early check-in for us, not easy when you are solidly booked out, but they made a plan for us to drop our stuff so that my kid could get to work on time. Overall it's an easy place to stay with a nice walking distance to Noda and we would stay again if they will have us."", ""I stayed in Lisa's place for 2 nights. Everything is exactly as described.

The kitchen is remarkably well equipped and cleverly laid out, and they have provided a lot of things that seem like they would be helpful for families traveling with children. We used the stack of menus in the welcome folder to decide on dinner our second night and were rewarded with an excellent, fresh Vietnamese meal from Lang Van.\nThe living room is smaller than it looks in the pictures, as well as not as bright. It is still very comfortable, though, but be aware if you have a larger group or kids that there is not a lot of room to maneuver.\nBe warned that the unit next door is also an AirBnB. They should make it clearer that this is a duplex, not what I have heard described as a bungalow. The walls are very thin, so you will hear the voices and footsteps of the guests next door (and I felt like I had to be extra careful myself so as not to disturb them). Since it is also a vacation rental property, you have no way of knowing who it will be. Our first night, we heard voices as the group next door came in, but it quickly died down and was absolutely fine. Our last morning, though, there were small children making a lot of noise from 6:30am on (quiet hours are posted, but how can you tell a toddler not to make noise?). I had specifically asked about neighbor noise and was told about the neighborhood (which is indeed quiet), but not about the potential for other vacationers to make a racket.

Kitchen things (olive oil, pasta, coffee k-cups, dish soap and dish detergent, some basic spices, still & sparkling water) were supplied…some from hosts but possibly some from past guests too. The apartment building was small, clean and quiet. Loved having a washer dryer in the unit w/supplied detergent.\nCons: I was traveling alone w/o a car (walked everywhere during 2-wk stay) and was unaware of the homeless problem in Charlotte — many homeless people are out walking regularly & while most were friendly, a few were aggressive/unstable/scary. The hot water in the shower was great, but after it was running for 3-4 mins, you could hear a high pitched squealing sound. The key for the stairs works on stairwell door outside front door of bldg - elevator wasn’t working one day & this info was crucial. Thanks to reviews, I brought Dohm sound machine from home to block out train :)', 'The Airbnb was in a great location and very comfortable. We were able to easily walk to downtown and Bank of America Stadium. Very cute and clean studio!', 'The condition of the apartment was excellent when I first arrived and the amenities provided added to the experience of my stay.

Very clean and spacious studio. I stayed by myself and they provided everything I needed. Shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion. Great bath towels. Kitchen had water bottles, coffee Keurig, bottle of wine, a couple light snack items. Very comfortable bed and bedding! Great TV. Plenty of detail on how to park and enter the space. Didn’t hear neighbors at all. A little tucked away so wouldn’t walk home at night alone. Would definitely stay here again!!', 'This place was in a perfect location especially for the conference center being less than 10 minutes away. The home was clean and had little touches that made it feel like home. The only issue I had was the parking spot barely fitting my Honda civic. But per Brad there is parking across the street. Would rec if having a bigger vehicle for sure. I would definitely stay again!', 'Great listing. Place is just as described. Highly recommend.', 'A true super host with additional amenities for our stay. I just want to say thank you for our amazing experience with your unit.', 'My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this property. Everything was clean and cozy, not to mention the location was perfect! When we ran into a parking issue, Brad and his wife were prompt to respond and resolved the situation in no time. Overall, we enjoyed our stay in Charlotte, partly because of this awesome rental property and its hosts!', 'We celebrated our anniversary staying here and we were not disappointed! The place was great, very clean, the bed and pillows so comfy! The location was good, not too far from city center that we couldn’t walk or take a scooter to everything! There was a crazy strong rain storm and there was a small leak, but Brad and Ana were quick to respond and more than accommodating! They came within 30 minutes and had it fixed and never interfered with our plans! We highly recommend their place and will definitely stay again when we visit Charlotte in the future!', 'Very lovely place to stay! In walking difference to all the uptown spots.

The neighborhood is peaceful, and I enjoyed the feelings of serenity and safety.', 'Great place to stay and plenty of things within walking distance', 'Great loft space! Very accurate description - would definitely stay here again!', ""Perfect apartment in uptown Charlotte's Fouth Ward. You'll find everything you need for a quick getaway or a longer stay. Within walking distance of any uptown attractions and a Harris Teeter; and only a 5 - 10 minute drive to Southend, Plaza Midwood, and Optimist Hall. Very easy access to I-77 and within 15 minutes of the airport. Checking in was a breeze and Brad is very responsive. Note that the parking spot is small, so anything larger than a smaller sedan will be complicated (but I understand other spots to park may be available nearby). The apartment is perfect for a couple. Definitely recomend and will come back."", 'Great', 'We loved staying at Brad’s apartment in Charlotte for the long weekend. The apartment is in a great location-easily walkable to all Uptown attractions and restaurants, and close by to lovely parks and a grocery store. The inside of the apartment is wonderful as well-it was spotless, thoughtfully decorated, and the floor to ceiling windows made for a great view of the sunsets in the evening. The bottle of wine, sweet treats, and water in the fridge were especially thoughtful touches. Check-in was very easy and Brad checked in to see how our stay was, which we appreciated. The parking spot provided with the apartment really is just for compact cars, so definitely keep that in mind-but we were able to find parking for the weekend about a block up with no problem. Overall, our stay in Brad’s place made our trip to Charlotte even better, and would happily return any time.', 'It was a very nice place to stay! Communication was clear and easy to follow. Getting in and checking into the building was listed in steps which was much appreciated. Thank you for being a great host!!', ""I've stayed in many places, but this one truly stands out. The loft was immaculate and managed with incredible attention to detail. From the coffee pods to the laundry detergent, every little thing was thought of. It was clear that Brad put in the effort to make the stay perfect. A fantastic experience all around!"", ""Brad's place is simply spectacular. We needed to be centrally located between Uptown, NODA, Southend, and UNCC. This industrial loft hit all of the high points - centrally located, secure, easy accessibility, designated parking (this is a HUGE deal), and stylish space. The extra touches made for a BIG impact - snacks, Figi and Pellegrino water, a super coffee station, individualized bath essentials plus a fabulous bottle of wine! We were very pleased with the amenities during our 4-night stay and look forward to many return trips!"", 'This airbnb is so beautiful! The space was perfect for my solo vacation to Charlotte. The building is nice and quiet, I was able to relax and get work done. The view from the windows are beautiful as well, the sunsets to die for as well.

Thank you!!!', 'Very nice location!', 'This house is exactly as pictured and described. Ashley and Dave have thought of everything and we felt right at home. The view and lake access are the main selling points and the neighborhood feels safe and quiet. My son and I went kayaking daily and my husband enjoyed fishing off the jetty. We ventured into downtown Mooresville nightly for good food and ice cream (a 10-15 minute drive). We worked remotely during the week so our internet connection was key and we found it to work well for our purposes. Oh and because I always care about the beds — the beds were extremely comfortable. Again the thoughtfulness of the hosts makes this place a wonderful stay.', 'Very nice, peaceful stay in a clean and comfortable house. Extremely quick response from hosts. Beautiful waterfront location and close to a lot of local places to eat and drink. Will absolutely return in the future.', 'Beautiful location with all the amenities. House was beautifully decorated and clean. Both indoor and outdoor spaces were perfect for our needs!!', 'We had an amazing time celebrating the 4th at the lake house. The house itself was beautiful. The open kitchen / living room was stunning. The bedrooms and bathrooms were clean and spacious. We had a great time enjoying meals out on the screened in patio. The stars of the property are all the outdoor areas. We had a great time hanging out and making drinks by the tiki hut. Our dogs had the time of their lives - swimming off the docks. We also spent a lot of time in the water ourselves and couldn’t get enough of everything the property had to offer. We hope to come back next summer!', 'Beautiful peaceful lake house.

I highly recommend this place!', 'This house was absolutely what I was looking for. Peaceful setting right on the Lake, but still close enough to anything you could possibly need for food and activities. It was close enough to the city that I was able to take in a Charlotte FC game during my trip, but far enough away that you could enjoy a lake life feel. I would stay here again without hesitation!', 'The lake house was adorable and I was impressed with how many little extra touches were included to make it feel homey and welcoming. For example, in the bathroom there were little extras in case you forgot things from home, like razors, ponytail holders, and hair pins.\nThe house was clean and cozy, and had things for everyone in the family to enjoy. My teenagers loved being right on the lake. My toddler had a blast on the swing set in the yard and in the sand on the little beach by the far dock. My husband had a great time fishing and caught brim, perch, bass, and two huge catfish. I found plenty of quiet and cozy places to read, relax, and enjoy being on the lake.\nI would highly recommend staying here!', 'Best girls trip!

There was so much room for the kids to play. Giant grassy area for them to run. A sandy area with all the toys. The dock was great. They also have so much to do even if you dont have a boat to go cruise the lake. She's got kayaks, paddle boards, a magic mat that the kids absolutely loved. The outdoor spaces were perfect.

We had such a lovely stay, would highly recommend!', 'Good location. The lake setup was terrific!\nThe Murphy bed in the upstairs room is pretty hard, probably ok for kids but harder on adults.

A great location on Lake Norman with kayaks, paddle boards, fishing equipment, etc. The place is large and spacious. There was coffee to drink, and a large grocery store 4 minutes away.

We loved the beach and outdoor facilities. The dock and outdoor bar were so much fun to use. We had a blast on the paddle boards. The deck by the house on the water was wonderful for sunbathing and relaxing. The screen porchI has such great furnishings and charming string lights everywhere! The back wall of windows steals the show though with great views of the lake and sunset. The kitchen was so well stocked. We even baked cookies!

Beds were comfy! The “extras” that Ashley and Dave provided is unlike anything we’ve ever had at a rental. Made me smile as I came across them all! No worries if you forgot something! Family games they provided were great and the screen porch space was perfect for that. Outdoors… THE BEST PART! You basically have your own private cove with steps into the lake to enjoy the water with ease and the sand they’ve added was a great touch! The tiki area was perfect, the guys watched golf, we listened to music and enjoyed so much time outside with the Lilly pad float, kayaks, paddle boards and floats! We also rented their boat which made lake life even more fun! Lake Norman is gorgeous! We will be back!', 'Nice', 'The cabin was in a perfect spot on the lake. Beautiful and peaceful which is just what we wanted. It was super clean upon our arrival, decorated so nice, super comfortable and full of amenities. The fully stocked kitchen had everything we needed for our meal prepping. The beds were so comfortable that we actually want to buy one just like it. There are big tv’s in every room which was nice, especially at the end of the night when we all went in our own rooms to settle in for the night. Having two bathrooms made it convenient for 5 guests. Also having a washer and dryer in the cabin was convenient. Won’t have to pack as much for our next trip to Lake Norman. The cabin was off the main road, set back away from everything, but close enough to jump on the highway to head north or south. Oh, and the fall foliage was magnificent. Wasn’t sure what to expect in November, but we would definitely return again in November. A little too cool for swimming, but very relaxing. Just what we needed.', 'This was a beautiful property and we couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay during our visit. We didn’t want to leave!!

It was very very clean, but the furniture is really uncomfortable - the mattress is hard and the 2 cheap leather chairs are hard to sit in for more than half an hour. Kitchen is nice - large counter, large fridge, etc.\nI was also a bit irritated because on our way to the place (coming from out of state) I realized that Jodi's place was a full hour from the conference I was attending and I had accidentally booked in the wrong town. Staying there would add 2 hrs of commute for my husband each day to drop me off & pick me up. I explained my mistake and asked Jodi if it was possible to just stay one night & cancel the other so we could find a place closer to the venue, & she refused. It seemed ungracious especially for just one night. I would not stay with her again."", 'I was nervous because it was the first time I used this service but I must say that me and my husband loved it !

However, we stayed for a week and a half, and had a few difficulties during our stay. There were only 4 forks and a handful of spoons and knives. This made it difficult to have more than 1 meal without needing to wash the dishes. However, I reached out to the host and he sent more silverware via Amazon the next day, which was great! We really appreciated that. Another hard part of staying there for an extended period of time was the lack of basic kitchen necessities. There was 1 chef knife that was dull, 1 spatula that was dirty, and a spoon that had seen it’s better days. There was no pepper, but there was salt… just don’t look at the bottom of the salt container :/ Also, the 2 pans were not in great condition.

The fridge had food spills and the oven was a bit dirty as well, we ate out for all our meals so it didn't bother us that much.

Most importantly, Udo\'s ""treehouse"" apartment is clean & comfortable, had working a.c. and television, a nice, compact kitchen, and was quietly nestled behind his home. I met Udo briefly upon check-in, and he seemed very nice & while I didn\'t need anything during my stay, I\'m sure he would have been responsive. The bathroom is a bit snug for a tall person like me and there was a dead bug in there, but those are minor compared to the overall comfort of the space. Highly recommend, and I would definitely stay there, again!', 'It was a great place!

Our host was lovely and stopped to chat with us for a little bit and was helpful with directions. Left a book of local recommendations for food and activities and some we had time to try and loved.

It’s quiet and secluded but close to many restaurants and things to do.', 'Our short stay will be long remembered! We came from out of town to see a concert that was canceled hours before the event which could’ve made our weekend a total bust. However, staying here made it completely worth the trip. There were 2 bikes available to us which we used for a full day and, thanks to Udo’s suggestion, lead us to see the city in a different way we wouldn’t have, without.

My only gripe is while the condo seems to have been renovated, the renovations do not seem to have been done great. There are areas where the floor is creeky and a lot of the fixtures don’t seem to be on correct (the handles on the sinks rotate in the counter and the toilet paper mounts turn in the wall for example). The condo was cleaned and maintained but there was a layer of dust in some spots like the lights in the bathroom and on some of the decorations. For me personally the view makes up for this but for the price to stay at the condo I would expect the condo to be cleaner and have less dust.

No one charges extra for bringing babies/ toddlers who can also be dirty and destructive; therefore i felt Chad’s place accepted my dog as part of my family and only expected his place to be treated with respect. I also picked his place for the perfect location. You can walk everywhere, specially with my dog. Close to nice restaurants uptown. His place was clean and charming. Cute little patio.

Adjacent garden with hammock and water feature made the space for us, plus the bathroom is huge and amazing. Bigger than expected with lots of sitting/“chillin” areas. Would stay again if needing to be 15 minute walk, or 5 minute Lyft, to the majority of downtown liveliness.

Very detailed instructions with pictures to check yourself in and out of the apartment. Ample easy and free parking. Many supplies in the unit- dish soap, laundry detergent pods, kitchen towels, paper towels, toilet paper, shampoo, body wash and hand soap. Canisters of ground coffee, powdered creamer, and sugar are on the counter to use with a single cup keurig style coffee maker (with reusable silicone kcup to fill). We suggest that a 4 or 8 cup traditional coffee maker would be a nice addition. We look forward to staying here again in the future!', 'Loved our stay at this charming and cozy apartment!

Getting into the apartment was straightforward and hassle-free. The area was very quiet, allowing for a peaceful stay. Additionally, parking was simple and convenient.\nThere were, however, a few items that need improvement. The walls were scuffed up and in need of a fresh coat of paint. The apartment could have been cleaned more thoroughly, and the pillows were hard and uncomfortable. The bathroom had a large hole in the shower wall which was covered with plastic and unappealing. When we arrived, there were towels and sheets left in the dryer, which was inconvenient. There were only three coat hangers, which is insufficient for two people. While there were pots and pans and utensils in the kitchen, there were no basic condiments like salt and pepper, so it wasn't fully equipped for cooking."", 'Amazing stay, definitely would book again!', 'it was a great place to stay !

Would definitely book again in the future.', 'The place is nice enough, but my overall experience was lackluster compared to what you might hope for out of this price range. The unit lacked common items such as cooking knives, and overall is quite minimal. Furthermore, I was notified >30min before the scheduled check in time that the shower was not operable, and I would have to use a different unit to bathe. On top of that inconvenience, the communication between multiple hosts, co-hosts, and the maintenance for the building to find a solution left me completely out of the loop and confused. As a result, I went 5 days out of my 8 day stay using the shower next door. One of the co-hosts offered a poorly thought out ""gift"" and entered the unit without my permission to deliver it.

Check-in/Check-out instructions were clear and easy to follow.\nA couple tips to pass along: if you wind up checking in late, try your best to keep the noise down to a minimum - which will prove to be a task 😅😂 even the littlest of sounds echo through the halls/building late in the evening. Also, the lights outside on the balcony are suuuper cute - however, if you’re trying to have a quiet night on the balcony without disturbing the neighbors, the lights are little too big/bright. Some fairy lights or even small LED Christmas lights would work better :)\nAll-in-all, 10/10 would stay here again! 😊', 'Jacks place is great!

Close enough to the city but not in the middle of the hype. Ubers/Lyfts are very reasonable. The bed is the most comfortable bed I’ve ever had at an Airbnb/rental.

I know it is tough to “fix it” when it’s a two night visit, but as a customer I felt I was putting in way more effort to find online fixes to the thermostat etc than the host which was frustrating.

Had everything we needed. Excellent host communication.', 'The place is incredibly cute and it’s comfortable. The shower was turned off when I stayed, which I wasn’t too sure would or would not be the case because it was January but also rainy and unseasonably warm. One thing that was super nice was Maryann left a lot of drinks and snacks in the tiny house as well as a blanket for the dogs. There were a lot of pillows on the bed, which was cute but I didn’t prefer because the house is so small that it was hard to find a space for them.

It was exactly as described, except that it was much quieter than mentioned (the neighbor dog barked some but I mostly just heard crickets and nature.) The outdoor shower was amazing, great pressure and nice and hot. Cheap Lyft ride into DT, and the host and her sister were so friendly. I only saw them once (though they were available if need be) but it enjoyed a quick chat outside before settling in and having total privacy. I absolutely loved it here and quickly got used to the more sustainable way of living (ie small space, compostable toilet, bowl handwashing and outdoor shower.) The only downside was that I didn’t stay longer!', ""The tiny house felt like glamping in the middle of the city and brought the best of both worlds. The outdoor shower was more luxurious than a lot of indoor showers, and the whole backyard was lush and beautiful. We almost forgot where we were, but even Maryann's gracious hospitality can't hide the sounds of traffic (which were noticeable, but not bad at all for 2 lifelong city kids).\nOne small thing that I'm not sure was made clear in the listing - the toilet is only separated from the main room by a curtain rather than a door, so I wouldn't recommend staying here with anyone you're not totally comfortable with.

The provided dog blanket was nice, both for the dog's comfort and to make it easier to keep the place clean. The heater kept it cozy for our late winter visit."", 'The place was just as described. We visited in mid-September, so weather was relatively mild. I did read that in the winter the shower may not be accessible as the shower is outdoors and may be winterized. The house does not have a sink inside. If using the restroom, there is hand sanitizer available or you must walk outside to wash hands with the shower. Despite the minor inconveniences, the place was reasonably priced for a quick stay in the Charlotte area. Uber/Lyft from the boat house to Uptown was around $15 each way. Very clean space and the TV comes equipped with streaming services. I’d stay here again if in the area!', ""Our adventure to Maryann's was just that...An Adventure!\nI can not say enough positive words about our host! Unfortunately, it the weather was not on our side and it was very cold (thank you Mother Nature). The portable heater in the Tiny Home was unable to keep up with the cold. My wife and I contemplated getting a hotel room because we were frozen. I did communicate this to Maryann and she was kind enough to open up her guestroom for us so we did not have to move.\nAside from that part of the stay, Maryann is extremely kind and gave us all kinds of tips! Where to eat and where to park in Charlotte.\nWe do look forward to our next trip to Charlotte and hope to stay again at MaryAnn's! You will not be disappointment with her kindness and hospitality!"", ""What a wonderful gem of a place to stay within! My partner and I were so cozy, even with our two dogs.

The beds were extremely comfortable and were perfect for getting a good nights rest after our day trips to Carowinds, the mall, and a concert. The shower is also amazing and is surprisingly peaceful and relaxing for it to be outdoors. I felt like a new man after each refreshing shower I took there. The host was also wonderful, giving clear directions and making sure that we got in safely. The door and colored glass surrounding the front of the Boathouse are just so cool to look at, I took so many pictures of it. The money is well worth the unique and one of a kind layout of the Boathouse and I would definitely stay here again.', 'Cute little “boat house” in the backyard that was perfect for our over night stay.

As someone visiting for 3 days/2 nights, I had plenty of to go containers. That trash can was too small. Especially considering there were no spare trash bags.\nCheckout time was 10am. What I didn't know was that the checkout instructions ask you to take the trash out, wash all dishes and put them away before leaving. The owner left 1 dishwasher tablet.

Second, the beautiful top to bottom windows are great during the day but at night create a real problem with noise, Saturday night sounded like we were at Charlotte Motor Speedway until about 3am with people racing by. Woke me and my wife up multiple times. Last, the building had some sort of issue with the pipes banging that next night (Sunday) from about 11pm to 2am, it sounds like it was banging right behind the headboard to our bed. Not ideal under normal circumstances but we were in town for my wife to take a very important exam and would’ve benefitted from a better nights sleep', 'An amazing stay!

The only complaints we all had were the lack of water pressure in all 3 showers and that the water in the showers was tepid at best. I let Shirley know my concerns and she sent a repairman out the next day despite me telling her not to worry about it. The repairman blamed the lack of water pressure on the shower head.

Clean, homey location', 'I had a great stay. The only issue was the key not working to lock the door so I had to cut my day short to make sure I got back because the unit is on the bottom floor and people walk that way often.

The host is very informative.', 'Really great place to stay', 'Nice cozy apartment in a great neighborhood! check in and instructions were on time and clear. would definitely stay again!', 'The location is great and Jacques was very responsive and quick to act on fixes we requested. The apartment gets the job done, but as we were staying for 2 weeks we became very well acquainted with the apartment’s “quirks”.\nThose quirks included: not having access to any closet storage, the one laundry closet that was available leaked from the ceiling and soaked our bags, two cockroach sightings the first day of our stay (but Jacques immediately came and sprayed and we didn’t see any others), broken coffee table upon arrival (although Jacques quickly fixed it), and some of the outlets stop working at random and a few don’t work at all.\nOverall, Jacques did his best to improve our stay which started on a low point with the broken furniture and cockroaches. The location is good and the place was very clean.', 'Host is professional and responsive. Location is ideal for anyone who loves to be in the heart of it all. Apartment was smaller than I expected and located on the bottom level which had its pros/cons. Only complaint is that place could’ve been cleaner - carpet in bedroom is very dirty and could use a deep cleaning', 'Very easy check in process, clear instructions!

We will check here first next time we plan to stay in Charlotte.', ""Very responsive, gave great recommendations and the location gives easy access to many local places.\nParking in Charlotte can be hectic at times so it's always nice when you have a dedicated parking lot.\nPersonally I would love a few more basic kitchen spices."", 'Great location, walkable, easy check-in/out.

It’s in walking distance to many restaurants and coffee shops, which is the best part. It was clean and the bed was comfortable and there was plenty of hot water. The shower had good water pressure. They give you a parking pass for one car, which was also nice. If you are a light sleeper, the bedroom does face a street that can get busy at night especially on weekends so you might need earplugs or a sound machine.', 'Great place to stay with lots of walkable restaurants and places to check out. Very clean apartment!', 'Great stay. Building quiet but the traffic on road nearby is a bit noisy…not all night…just early evening and a.m\nOtherwise a great location and amenities. I will be back!', 'The house was clean and Jacquese was very responsive. Location was ideal for eating, drinking, and having a good time. Check out was a breeze.\nCons: there is no closet and practically no drawers for clothes. We were there for a very long weekend and having to live out of our suitcase in the room that was already tight was not ideal.\nVery little supplies so make sure you get what you need at the store prior to arriving/needing items.\nWe had to change the smoke detector batteries as they kept going off. While Jacquese was responsive and brought new batteries within a few hours of being told, it wasn’t ideal. The blinds were broke, again not a big deal but annoying when the sun is hitting in. The bathtub drains extremely slow.\nThe construction across the street is loud and starts early. Now the owners fault but something to note if you aren’t wanting to be up at the crack of dawn.\nAll in all the place was a nice spot to rest our heads for the weekend.', 'The host was very helpful because we was last min booking and we was glad we was able to book with them at the last minute and they was very nice the place was very clean and nice we felt like we was at home and I will very much book with them again', 'I would recommend this place for a quick getaway !!

The host provided detailed information and I do appreciate that.', 'Great place to stay.', 'Nice place to stay and do shopping.', 'This was a great place for our quick trip to Charlotte. The location was great, right on the edge of downtown and within walking distance of many food options and the concert venue we were going to.

The location and space were perfect. We will be back!', ""If you read one review, read this one. The host isn't going to like this review I'm sure, but I would not stay here again. Yes, the host describes the A/C unit noise and does provide earplugs, but I went 2 nights with very little sleep due to the loud slamming bang of the AC unit (when it kicks on) and noise of it running that follows. It's unlike anything I have ever experienced at a rental before.\nThe space was clean and had super quirky décor. The bed was massive and the mattress was comfortable.\nI think the host is in between a rock and hard place. The AC unit is for the whole building (multiple restaurants and flats) and it just happens to be directly above the bedroom in this unit.\nOverall it's not the hosts fault, but potential renters should be aware of the issue at hand."", 'Nice apartment!

We enjoyed our stay here and would gladly rent from Marc again.', 'Great place, lots of room, feels private. Perfect for a couple. You are right in the mix of the NoDa.

The bar next door and the air conditioning are definitely loud. This wasn’t an issue for me cause I can sleep thru anything but definitely something to keep in mind. The parking lot is a bit hidden but the pictures provided in the instructions were very helpful. Overall I thought it was a very cute and nice spot!', 'This was a really nice place for our stay. Cool, funky, eclectic neighborhood with some fun restaurants and shops. We were there for a show at the Neighborhood Theatre, which was a three minute walk from the loft so that was wonderful!

You can walk out of the front of the building, and immediately enter any of the neighborhood’s wonderful eats or listens. The unit was secure and clean.

Lots of sweet touches such as laundry soap, toiletry bags and dish soap. Highly recommended!', 'Perfect location and cute set up. I would definitely rebook.', 'Booked Marc’s place last minute and holy crap not only did the property exceed expectations but the neighborhood is an absolute goldmine of great local businesses!\nBook your stay and then check out Smelly Cat Coffee for incredible coffee and breakfast sandwiches , Salud Cerverceria for top tier pizza and amazing beer selection, Jack Beagle’s for incredible wings and gourmet Mac & cheese, all within walking distance.\nThe only recommendation I’d make is to bring ear plugs. At night there’s an extremely loud rooftop unit that might wake up light sleepers.

The biggest problem we had, which Chuck has absolutely no control over, was the overnight roadwork. Flashing police lights, huge spotlights, shouting workers, and even a pile driver from 10 pm to 6 am. This is a temporary problem but we got very little sleep. When the roadwork is finished, I think it is fairly quiet, with only usual road noise. We would definitely stay again after the roadwork is over."", 'Great stay.', ""Chuck's greeting, cleanliness, hospitality, easy set up instructions along with detailing welcoming mannerism into his smell good home was simply astonishing.

The host was incredibly responsive and communicated well throughout our stay, which I really appreciated.\nHowever, a couple of things to be aware of: the apartment is on the 2nd floor facing a busy road, so you can hear traffic pretty much at all hours. The walls are also quite thin, so if you're a light sleeper, this might be an issue. Additionally, there's a 7-Eleven right across the street, and the bright lights do shine into the apartment at night, which might be bothersome if you're sensitive to light.\nOverall, it's a good spot if you're looking for convenience and don't mind the noise and light, but if you're someone who needs a quiet, dark space to sleep or for work, it might not be the best fit."", 'Space was amazing Jack was very responsive', ""Jack was very communicative with check-in instructions and making sure everything was good for us.

The couch doubles as a pull out bed, but it’s very uncomfortable for extended seating which makes watching tv difficult.\nThe baseboard in both the room and bathroom were dirty.

In the other direction, you can paddle to a park with a beach and if you continue there are several places you can get out and swim. Beautiful river, we spent all 3 days on it.\nWe weren't in the house much, but heard the person above us walking around both mornings (and once when we were eating on the patio they were above us on their deck). But it's not a deal breaker. It was during times of normal activity and it was normal volume. If you plan on sleeping until noon, pack earplugs, but don't miss out on this place because of it.\nThe Keurig coffee maker has a power button on the back of the right side. It took me doing a Google search to figure out how to turn it on, so try to remember that. ;) The complimentary pods and sugar/creamer were very much appreciated. The kitchen had everything I needed. Even a well-stocked spice rack!\nThe wifi was strong for streaming music, but we didn't turn on the TV's. The yard is flat enough for corn hole, and boards were provided.

The only negative I would say about this Airbnb is the location. You do have to drive past a gas station that host a few druggies. I’m from New York, so sceneries like that does not scare me however, we did pull into the gas station and there was a few who approached us asking for money.\nIf you not experienced any kind of rough area before seeing something like that may be a little off putting.

We had to use the broom to sweep them up anytime we left or came back. They actively kept dropping while we were even sweeping it.

This appears to have been a small house that\'s been split down the middle to make two even smaller spaces. The problem with that is the dividing wall between this unit and one next door is thiiiiiin. So thin, we heard full conversations of the loud-ish neighbors. Same with creaky floorboards; totally normal in an older home like this, but we could feel the neighbors walking, and I\'m sure vice versa. Other than that, we felt a little cramped. Small nightstands, nowhere to put ""stuff"" in the bathroom, no place to get ready (most ladies need a hair/makeup spot), just a small loveseat and not a full couch. Again, these are just personal preferences and does NOT mean this is not a cute place! Just know going in that it will be small. Other than that, happy with the parking, king size bed, neighborhood, and the responsive host. Would definitely recommend!', 'Great place to stay with your dog!

I've been many times and will continue to come back. This is an awesome spot."", ""A great spot for 1-2 folks looking to stay in the Villa Heights neighborhood. Driveway makes parking a breeze and its central location in the neighborhood means its a 10-20 minute walk from some great local spots. If getting to events in other parts of Charlotte, its a short drive to every other popular neighborhood in the city.\nHome itself is spot-on what's advertised. If you need to cook, the kitchen was well stocked with dishware, cutlery and other equipment you might need. Full-sized fridge means plenty of room for groceries or leftovers.\nI think this place is ideal for folks needing a comfortable place to crash and spend a lot of time out and about. There are a few things missing for folks who want to spend a lazy day in: TVs are older and small, no full size couch or ottaman for lazy lounging, and no ice maker in the freezer so you'll need to bring your own.\n5/5, would and probably will stay again."", 'We enjoyed our stay in Charlotte and would definitely stay here again.

The natural lighting is impeccable and the blackout curtains are perfect at night with the bright lights from the railroad next door. My only complaint is the freight train going by several times at 2 and 3am. The fire alarms also went off in the complex at one point, but that had nothing to do with the host. Very easy to get to. 10 min ride from uptown Charlotte. The apartment was very homey and spacious. The corkscrew was super appreciated. I saw the wine glasses in the cabinets so I grabbed a bottle of wine when I walked to CVS. I didn’t even think to grab one. But the apartment was fully stocked with practically everything.

The noise is so great that a white noise machine and ear plugs are provided for your use.\nInside of the unit was clean, except for the closet. The closet was cluttered with cleaning supplies all over the floor which was not appealing to say the least.\nWhen we arrived, we noticed a infuser running by the bed. Not a fan we unplugged it and went out to visit the town. That evening, while adjusting to the noise of the trains, we noticed a odor by the head of the bed. Not sure what it was but went to sleep regardless. The following evening with the diffuser being unplugged all day long the smell became clearly noticeable so much so I had to sleep on the sofa.\nFinally, the property was under some sort of structural repairs.

Will definitely be staying here when we come back to Charlotte.', 'Sunny’s place was nice INSIDE. But the location of the place was very unsafe in my opinion. I did not expect the place to be in this location upon arrival. Once I arrived to the airbnb, it immediately smelt like marijuana and it smelt that way the entire trip inside and out. I did not feel comfortable using some of the kitchen supplies. However, Sunny communicates well and the pictures are accurate however I still felt unsafe in the area. It is a perfect location because you are in Uptown and it is easily accessible to everything it is just unfortunately not in the safest area.

I had to contact AirBnB support (since they were not responding to my messages) because I needed to sleep for my tournament next day.

It is also very close to I277 so easy to get to from all parts of the city.\nOne note, for some reason Charlotte is a loud city. I wasn't the only one to notice this (others at our convention mentioned they couldn't sleep because of all the noise.) so bring ear plugs! The first night I made the mistake of not using them. There is just lots of people revving engines, racing on the streets, etc. This is not an AirBnB problem - it is a Charlotte problem.

The proximity was perfect for everything I had planned this weekend. I was able to complete a lot of my favorite stops but I found a couple of new ones this trip.

Nitan as well as the other cohosts were incredibly responsive with any questions and making sure everything with our stay was going well. All around very kind! The noise from the surrounding area outside was loud but we had been expecting that as mentioned in other reviews. The listing did mention that there was a balcony. It was not a full balcony but still a place to open the window and look outside if you wish to do so.

You will be staying over a “private space” and if you disturb them in any way (like shining your car lights in their space) you will be charged a fee.

Ross is a nice host and very responsive.', 'Unfortunately, we had to cut our trip short for reasons completely unrelated to the quality of the AirBnB, so take my experience with a grain of salt. The check-in process was clear. The BnB was clean and orderly. Ross was responsive and friendly. That said, the little things may make or break this place for you. The BnB is effectively a MIL suite in the backyard of the host’s house—which in and of itself is fine—but you will hear kids running around. You’ll need to do a three-point turn to get out the parking spot allocated to you as a guest. The windows in the living room and bathroom do not have blinds or privacy filters. This may not concern you, as the suite is on the second story, but for my wife, she felt exposed when using the facilities, with a full view of the neighbor’s backyard. If you can live with these compromises, then hey, it’s a great deal located in the heart of Noda, restaurants and entertainment all around, with a well-organized host with plenty of recommendations.', 'Convenient, quiet location.\nAppreciated the soft, extremely comfortable bed.

Despite this, the host insisted we pay the pet fee before sharing the check-in instructions. I managed to pay the fee while on the highway once I had enough reception, but this lack of empathy was disappointing. The place felt much less appealing than the photos, with a strong musty odor that smelled like someone used to smoke inside the house, combined with the scent of dirty carpets and feet. There’s also a strange rule prohibiting guests from opening windows, which the space clearly needs for ventilation. To make it worse, there’s an additional charge if you do open them. The bathroom shower had rust, the walls were dirty, and the air vent in the hallway had a thick layer of dust—it felt very unclean. The listing also fails to mention that this is a duplex. After paying approximately $730 for three nights, I can confidently say that the value does not match the price.', 'Good spot. Road out front is a little busy at times but no noise inside.

I’m thankful they allowed pets, they also enjoyed their stay as well, and they even provided a comfy dog bed my pup was able to sleep on. The back patio was super adorable with nice light fixtures.

I did four walks in the neighborhood and felt safe and felt peace as it was such a beautiful area. The Airbnb itself was absolutely cozy and I don’t think I have ever slept in a more comfortable bed.

I highly recommend this spot and I will be staying again during my next visit in Charlotte.', 'Ruben was a great host! The airbnb was exactly as it was listed and was super clean and cozy. We asked if they had an HDMI cord and they went out of their way to search for one for us. The only reason I had to give a 4 star rating is because unfortunately, my car was stolen. We believe it was The Kia Boys because of the way it was stolen, wrecked and abandoned. We spoke with Ruben and he was shocked and expressed that nothing like this has ever happened in their neighborhood before. I believe him, as the neighborhood did feel very safe, quiet and well maintained. I just felt like I should say something so everyone is aware and takes the proper precautions.', 'I had a great stay at Ruben’s place, the home and neighborhood are very nice and it’s really close to the city and many other things to do.

I will definitely be staying here again!', 'We loved this place! The listing was accurate, and the host was great.

The location was great. We will definitely stay again!', 'My husband and I enjoyed our time here. There is plenty of space for two people.

The bed was super comfortable and we loved the large bathroom with two sinks. Parking was easy and one of the best things about Enya’s place was the location.

I loved how clean it was and so well appointed! Enya was very responsive when I had a question. The home has 'soft towels!' This was so appreciated and sometimes over looked by home owners. I loved having the extra blankets. I really enjoyed my stay. I love to walk and there is a great trail that connects to the street as well as a great walking neighborhood. The home has a lot of character and it just charming!\nI am a light sleeper and could hear noise from a freeway at night, however I travel with earplugs so I was good. One thing I wish were different, you can not control the thermostat in the home. It is in a home next door I think. It would turn off during the night and I would get hot."", 'Beautiful and spacious. The L is a nicely renovated quaint home with the perfect location within walking distance to Bank of America Stadium.

One improvement I’d recommend is to replace the couch. Quite uncomfortable. Otherwise a great place to stay.', 'Enya and her husband Chuck were phenomenal hosts! I was in Charlotte on business for ten weeks and would not have been able to be energized for the duration of my stay if I wasn’t in a space as comfortable as their unit. They were extremely responsive; any issues that came up were resolved quickly.

She was always responsive and made sure we had what we needed at all times. The only downside to this beautiful unit was the neighbors.

The inside of the house looks exactly like the pictures. Not much of a skyline veiw that i was expecting. Landscaping outside of the house could have been better.

Parking could be a little chaotic.', 'Great stay, great price, great location! Enya was super responsive. 30 minute walk to the center of the uptown area. Place was very spacious and clean. Can’t wait to stay here again!', 'We had a nice stay at Enya’s AirBnB. The wash machine was not very functional and extremely noisey. Overall, the stay was comfortable.', ""I've stayed in close to 20 properties, and this is my favorite. The neighborhood is awesome: safe, eclectic, and quiet (other than the interstate noise which honestly didn't bother me at all). The location is perfect for walking and taking the light rail Uptown. The hosts are responsive and friendly. A+ across the board.\nI choose AirBNB properties over hotels because it gives you a true feel for the city and a chance to explore, and this was perhaps the best example I've experienced.

I loved the big bathroom, a whole table for me to do art, and the bonus room where I kept my things a mess and was able to be more tidy in the bedroom. The only issue was that the thermostat was controlled somewhere else, so I had to keep messaging her to turn the AC on and off… But she was very quickly responsive, and would do it right away, which was great.', 'This Airbnb is very cozy and clean.

I read the instructions and watched the video but was confused after a long drive about the parking in the garage. When I called, the person answering did not speak good English. When I became frustrated, he disconnected the call. Apparently, you can park anywhere but residential numbers and guest? Although the piece that you put in your car has a number? Anyway, the next night, we had an issue with the side gate but thankfully there was a person in the office who was able to direct my husband and clearly explain the process. When I reached out to Trifecta and to Airbnb, they did address our issues and made sure we were taken care of. Overall it was not a bad experience. I would say that if you have mobility issues, there is a long walk from the elevator to this unit. Also, the bed is not the most comfortable… it’s like being in a dorm room. I wasn’t a fan of the linens or the bed in general. Overall it was clean and a convenient location.', 'Very nice / convenient.

Carpet needs replacing, walls/baseboards need to be cleaned and repainted. There were scuffs along the walls in every room and baseboards throughout house were dirty/stained. We did not reach out to have the cleaners come back through as it would not have made a difference since things needed to be replaced rather than cleaned. Could tell it was owned by a corporation rather than an individual owner as it was furnished with the cheapest of cheap.

We found it very comfortable and for the price you can’t beat it. The owners are very responsive and we were able to check in early.

It did have dove shampoo, conditioner and body wash, and a full set of plates, cutlery, and glasses. THAT'S IT. Fully stocked where? Not to mention the upstairs neighbors were HORRENDOUS. Moving furniture, stomping, banging, scratching, ALLLLLL NIGHT...like when I say all night, ALL NIGHT.

Less than 5 minutes walking to the Bank of America stadium. There’s a pub across the street that was packed for the soccer game that day so it was a lot of fun. In the middle of the night, we were locked out of the building and there was no one at the front desk to let us in. I hesitantly had to contact the host at 3am and bless their soul, they responded with instructions. The elevator was broken during our stay, and apparently had been for 2 months according to the front desk workers so if you can’t do stairs to the second floor or have mobility issues, I would contact the host to see if it’s fixed by then.

That is very inconvenient and gives you less time to have use of this space. If check out time is at 11am, why should it take the cleaners 4-5 hours to clean that one space to get ready for the next guest? I had an event scheduled at 7pm, but check in time was at 5pm which would’ve only gave me 2 hours to check in, get cleaned up and make it to my event. My flight landed at 11am and I had to just find things to do, waisting time, money and gas, couldn’t shower, couldn’t get any rest all because I had to wait all the way up to 5pm to check in just to check out in 18 hours, not even 24. And the cameras are very odd. If you don’t trust your guest enough that you need cameras than maybe you shouldn’t be hosting an Airbnb.', 'Great spot. Cool vibe.

Thank you, Mary!!', 'absolutely the most beautiful, cozy and peaceful Airbnb I have ever stayed. Mary is beyond a super host! she is personable and makes you feel so welcome. It is a local staycation for me but seems miles away. The breakfast and supper were amazing!! I highly recommend this beautiful property and civil war era cabin. Everything you need. And bring your fishing gear. Well stocked pond. See you soon Mary Grooms! Will be enjoying many stays here.\nThank you for your amazing hospitality! Oh and must mention most comfortable bed!!', ""This was my second stay with Mary, but it will not be the last. There aren't enough good words to describe her as a host, or how comfortable the accommodations are. I always sleep good there. Not to mention she had food prepared for me for two of the three nights I stayed. Perfect host, peaceful place. Never hesitate to book with her."", ""I spent 4 nights and 3 days here. This is a beautiful, peaceful property. I loved listening to the frogs singing at night and watching the ducks, geese, deer, and squirrels from the porch overlooking the beautiful pond. I was looking for a personal retreat to work on some overdue projects and Mary's place was perfect!\nAnd the food! I probably gained 5 lbs this weekend because of Mary's generous helpings of yummy breakfast and dinners. She is an absolute gem of a person!\nTheir residence is much closer to the cabin than it appears in the picture, but the cabin is situatd for privacy, and 1/2 the time, I never even heard Mary deliver my meals! She is responsive if you need her, but also is very respectful of your privacy.\nThe only negative for me was the bed. It is a thick memory foam mattress that is way too soft for my back. I ended up sleeping on the couch which was just the right firmness for me.\nI hope to take more retreats to this wonderful property in the future!"", 'Cozy, clean and just adorable cottage that feels like you stepped into a Time Machine but with modern comforts. The land surrounding is so gorgeous and peaceful as well and was decorated for the holidays which only added to the charm.

Peaceful surroundings, beautiful pond, you could hear the wind and birds instead of traffic but 5 minutes down the road are grocery stores and Target. Mary is so easy to talk to and was able to answer questions, gave us clear directions to the cabin and was available for anything even though she was on vacation herself. The cabin is quaint, love the antique decor. The bedroom floor made us a little nervous since you can see thru it but after a day or so you dont notice it. Bathtub is nice and plenty big enough. Kitchen was a pleasure to cook in, loved the gas stove.', ""The cabin was perfect for what we needed. Quiet, relaxing, private. Mary is such an amazing host. Her meals are all home cooked.

I'm already making plans to go back during the spring or fall when everything is in bloom."", 'Awesomeness', ""Overall, a 5-Star experience! We wanted a nice small cabin and that's exactly what we got! Mary even made breakfast and dinner for us and left it out on the cabin porch (wrapped and packaged) and it was delicious! Definitely was not expecting that! We didn't arrive for check in until about 10 pm and she stayed up and received us out ahead of the cabin. We had a bit of trouble finding the cabin itself but she called us on the phone and even gave us step-by-step instructions! On top of having a wonderful host, the view around the cabin was INCREDIBLE! Beautiful lake, very peaceful to sit out on the porch and enjoy our meals. The cabin had everything we needed and then some! 10/10 would HIGHLY recommend! We're looking forward to our next stay here!"", 'Wow! What an incredibly beautiful cabin located on an absolutely gorgeous property with such a lovely couple who own it!\nMy girlfriend and I spent 2 nights here and we could not have asked for a more peaceful weekend away. We felt the presence of Jesus the entire weekend while in the cabin, in the canoe on the dam, walking around the property and sitting on the deck at 11pm!\nMary is so sweet and really went out of her way to ensure that we were happy, our tummies were full and that we were relaxed! She made us breakfast and dinner every day which she left on the deck and we could eat when it suited us😊\nThe cabin has everything you need and if there’s anything you need, there’s a little shopping center about 8 minutes down the road.\nThis whole weekend we spent here was one of my favourite trips I’ve ever done and I can’t wait to go back to this cabin again! I’m still in disbelief at how perfect this place was and how friendly Mary was!\nI could not recommend this place enough!', 'Our stay at Cabin Fever was wonderful. Mary was the best host! The stay included home cooked breakfast AND dinner, which was delicious! My only regret is that we already had dinner plans with friends the nights we were there, so we weren’t able to to enjoy dinner at the cabin when it was hot. It made for great lunch leftovers though!

Hope we can get back for another visit!', ""Mary's cabin exceeded expectations. Absolutely a wonderful place to relax and escape the busy city. And only a 30 minute drive to the center of Charlotte. Mary surprised us every day with home cooked breakfast and supper delivered by her to the porch. It was so peaceful and quiet. Sat and watched mother nature around the 2 acre pond. Completely relaxed. Wonderful stay. But most impressive was how endearing Mary is with her genuine southern hospitality."", 'Mary and Barry were so friendly and welcoming! We were not expecting the delicious dinners and though we didn’t get to eat breakfast, she made sure we had something ready to go since our days started before daybreak. The furniture was very comfortable and the rustic decor was exactly what we like. The history about the cabin and decor was interesting and perfectly conveyed. At night, the air was filled with the songs of spring peepers and the mating chatter of blue herons roosting in the trees. Mr. Barry said he didn’t realize that’s what they were and was glad to learn something new☺️. We were honored to meet this beautiful and industrious couple and hope to visit again, maybe a bit longer next time. Highly recommend them if you want to relax and take a time out for yourself!', 'Mary was an amazing host. She brought us home cooked breakfast and dinner.

We were lucky enough to have delicious breakfast and dinners and provided. We will definitely be back.', 'Beautiful little cottage. So clean and peaceful. :) Mary was so kind!', ""I just loved my stay at Mary's cabin. It is rustic and comfortable. I came to do a nature spiritual retreat and it was the perfect location. The view from the back porch is stunning. I spent many hours in the rocking chair looking out over the lake, journaling. There was a family of geese, two parents and two little goslings. They were fascinating to watch. But for me it was the forest and trails that really made my stay so magical. The forest is a two minute walk from the cabin, so I went for hours to pray and meditate, came back to rest, and then returned most evenings, even taking a moonlit walk one night.\nMary couldn't have been more welcoming and kind. The warmth and helpfulness people spoke of in these reviews is the real deal with her. My 3-night stay was so soul-restoring, I can't wait to come back again and again. Mary's cabin is a really special place."", 'Mary was kind and responsive and easy to work with when my plans changed last minute. The historic log cabin was adorable and exactly as advertised.

Upon arrival, we encountered several issues, including stained throw pillows on the bed and a dirty refrigerator. Additionally, someone entered the 1st floor after 9 pm, in violation of the stated no-interruptions-after-9 pm rule. To make matters worse, the back entrance gate was obstructed by an RV/trailer, and there was inadequate lighting to locate the latch. The walkway to the front door was covered in slippery leaves, creating a safety hazard. Large piles of dog poop marred the grass in front of the Airbnb entrance. On the last day, we requested to leave early due to these issues, but we were informed that it went against the cancellation policy, which required a 5-day notice for cancellation.

It’s out back and you have to walk from the road down the driveway and squeeze between a truck and the porch and go through a gate with all your stuff which was hard.\nAlso, the heating/ air was in Celsius and the remote was confusing and it was hard to figure out. We used the fireplace heat which was great.\nLast negative was they have dogs, which was stated but when we left there was dog poop in the yard that we almost stepped in.\nWe loved the place but the worst part is trying to get to it with your stuff. That was tough.', 'Cliff and Andrea’s place was perfect for our quick trip to Charlotte!

The location could have been difficult to find but the host couldn’t have been more clear in the directions so we had no issues. Customer service and responsiveness was EXCEPTIONAL! When I noticed there were no wine glasses (which apparently were there at one point and someone likely took them as a souvenir) the host responded immediately, ordered glasses for us and they were on the doorstep just hours later. Truly above and beyond! The loft itself was sparkling clean and so comfortable. We actually spent a lot of time just chilling on the sofa and watching tv.

The kitchen was a little lacking in some utensils but we were able to make do since we didn't really need to do any cooking.

You won’t regret picking this place. If I could give 10stars I would.', 'Great location! Loft was amazing', ""I had a great one month stay here! The location is a huge perk of staying here. Romare Beardan park is about a 10 minute walk. The view from the loft is amazing. You can't go wrong with floor to ceiling windows. The host was very responsive whenever something came up. Overall a very cozy place to stay, can be a little noisy but ear plugs worked just fine for that. I would definitely love to stay here again!!"", 'Cleaning crew had not made it there yet, but the company quickly got them out to clean and situate the place for us on a Saturday .

The BNB was clean and had the necessities for me. This BNB can truly accommodate a 2-person stay if sharing a bed. The only pause (thus 4 stars but not in the host control) is a visitor’s comfort level with a metro city and downtown night culture. Let me say I never felt any fear but this neighborhood during my stay did have homeless citizens mingling during the day and night hours. I only suggest being vigilant as with any city and having a level of surroundings awareness if you are staying/traveling alone. Also, there is a dog park within 100 yds and in hindsight (onus on me) I would not have chosen this BNB as there was barking at times at night.', 'Super nice place and very friendly host - one of the best AirBnB stays I’ve had', 'The place is as advertised.', 'Great place to stay.

Everything was good and the location is awesome as you can walk to the downtown area including the BoA Stadium and the Spectrum Center for NFL and NBA games.', ""Enjoyed my time in this easy-access, cozy, private home-stay. The host was on vacation, so his response to my initial reservation was a few hours delayed, but after that he responded immediately with every communication. This upstairs nest is situated completely away from the rest of the house. The restroom is downstairs. After a few messages with the host a few hours after check in due to the heat setting briefly taking on a mind of its own, there was no problem with the heat, and the space is really cozy and had everything I needed. Apple TV and Netflex were a plus, and the biggest bonus is his golden retriever, Zoë. While I was there she was behind a gate (the host was away and had a friend staying), but so friendly and lovely! Highly recommended. Incredibly beautiful, historic area directly connected to uptown - literally 3 minutes to Belk Theater car (12- minute walk).

Davids dog is cute and cuddly. It was a very nice stay.', 'He was very kind and responsive, clear instructions on how to get into the house and all around had a great stay.', 'This Airbnb was better than I could’ve imagined it would be! The location was ideal for my needs. As someone willing and able to walk, I was fortunate enough to spend 5 days here and not have to Uber a single time other than coming from the airport. The neighborhood is simply stunning with tons of old house and a peaceful park nearby. The house itself was fantastic. My room felt very private and even practicing my (very loud) instrument and talking on the phone didn’t seem to be disruptive to David. It is a very spacious room with high ceilings for a loft, and I was even able to do practice yoga with no issues. Everything is labeled which made it easy to navigate all the amenities, of which there are many. David is very friendly and cool, and his dog is incredibly sweet. 11/10 on this place!', 'Exactly what I needed for a quick work visit - and super conveniently located. David was a thoughtful and considerate host. I would stay again in a heartbeat!', 'The room was so perfect for my weekend stay in Charlotte. David was very quick to respond and super kind whenever I had questions. The stay felt so private and comfortable. The room was very pleasantly designed and had very cool technology in it for the lights. Wifi was very strong, shower water pressure was great. Would 1000% stay here again. Thanks David!', 'I was in Charolette for a conference at the Charolette Convention Center for a few days, and David’s loft was the perfect place to stay. It was only ~1 mile away, so perfect walking distance during the day and at night. The loft itself was beautiful, and the bathroom was large and quite accommodating. David had everything that was posted on his listing and more. My favorite highlight was the light control panel that could be accessed as you enter the room, and right from the bed. If I come back to Charolette, I would definitely stay again!', 'This is an original style Airbnb. By that, I mean that you are using a home, guest space, or vacation spot that is owned and cared for by an individual or family. I noticed some of the other choices in the neighborhood are operated by investment groups. David is a nice host who knows the area. The home is charming and comfortable. As it is a home and not a vacant space, there are lots of useful items if you need something. There are stores, small parks, and restaurants within walking distance.', 'Convenient location for my needs & is best for a short stay. David has a dog that you can pet but I didn’t get the chance to. It was easy to find the place, and clear instructions were provided to get into it. The host does warn you about the limited parking space so I’d suggest you have a small car. The bedroom and space provided were accurate minus some decor changes and very clean. The neighborhood is very quiet. I’m a woman and felt safe staying here.', ""WORTH IT! Definitely stay here if you can, the bed is comfy, the room is great, and it has everything you need. It didn't really feel like sharing a room in someone's house, you very well had your own private space. The bathroom was amazing, especially since it came with stream jets. And don't get me started on the location! the restaurant right across the street was great but you can walk 10-15 minutes to the center city! Very safe, super comfortable, 100% walkable, private and very clean. I will definitely be back. Thank you David!\nP.s. Make sure you say hi to Zoë!"", 'This place is wonderful! It’s a gem! Great location to downtown. Beautiful homes surround his home. I highly recommend and we will be returning!!', 'Lovely home in a fantastic location.

David was very responsive and nice!', 'I was very pleased with the room, David is responsive and flexible, if you have not been to Charlotte then this is the place to stay, right in the Forth Ward which is beautiful and historical area, lovely walk to uptown (15-20 mins), I prefer to walk if it is not too hot and humid. I had a great experience.', 'I had a great week staying at David’s lovely house in a historic neighborhood right on the edge of downtown Charlotte. I was able to leave my car in the designated parking space (very helpful because parking on the street in the area for longer than two hours is impossible) and walk to my job at the Belk Theater downtown every day. David was very accommodating, helpful, friendly, and responsive, and his dog, Zoe, is wonderful, too! Zoe and I got to be buddies during the week I was there, which was a huge added bonus. The living space is separate enough from the main part of the house that guests can have plenty of privacy, and the bed is very comfortable. Great spot altogether!', 'Very nice room and a walkable neighborhood. Very clear instructions for everything. Super convenient location. Also a very cute dog!', 'David was extremely responsive when I had a problem getting into the property. He called me, despite being in Spain.\nThe only thing I wish was different was that there was a bathroom attached to the bedroom rather downstairs.\nOther than that, it was delightful.

Check-in was very easy.', 'The location was great! Super close to the city, but still in a cute little neighborhood. The Victorian style homes are so fun. Not really a place to stay if you want to hang out in your room for an extended period of time. It was just a great place to rest my head!', 'Stayed at David’s place for a work trip. It is very walkable to Uptown. The space is clean and roomy. The loft has a great desk that is convenient to use a laptop. The linens are clean and the bed is new and comfortable. David gave clear instructions. I would stay here again.', ""David's victorian home is perfect and surrounded by a whole neighborhood of beautiful homes. It's location was ideal for all of my activities while in Charlotte. The accomodations were exactly as described. I met David and Zoey, his puppy.

Great location, easy to walk downtown, clean and comfortable place with a very nice host. A must stay!', 'The place was exactly as listed. David was extremely helpful and friendly. We had good communication and I would highly recommend staying here.', 'David went above and beyond with communication, even caught an error between the dates I initially booked and the information I had given him. Without his attention to detail I would have lost the job I had traveled 5 hours to Charlotte for. His home reflected the same positive experience.\nEverything you could want out of an Airbnb, clean and comfortable room that felt like home, a private bathroom and entrance that didn’t make you feel like a burden in someone’s space.\nDavid’s place is awesome and I’d highly recommend it to anyone traveling to Charlotte!', 'Thanks for great stay. The room was setup with everything you need including desk, big tv, mini fridge. Bathroom well appointed. Shared living space but honestly felt very private to me and David is very welcoming. Fantastic spot to walk to uptown Charlotte.', 'Love the area! Great restaurants, and beautiful homes. Everything is walkable. Second stay!', 'Charming place that’s nicely decorated. The location is great with many food options in the area. Great value for the price. David was nice and responsive as well.', 'Such a find!

Looks exactly like the photos, has good amenities, one of the most comfortablest beds EVER, and Daniel himself was a joy as a host and conversationalist. One thing I truly appreciated about Mr, Daniel is he was accommodating to me coming an hour early, and allowing me to use a spare belt and charger due to me being forgetful.

On a weekday, it seems to be around 8am-6pm.

Brianna supplied us with a couple local beers that were delicious and the kitchenette was a good size for us to use. The only things we’d recommend would be a bigger vanity in the bathroom to put your things on while getting ready, maybe a shelf in front of the bed for us to put our iPad on to lay comfortably(it’s the Olympics currently so we wanted to watch) or maybe a small 32inch on the wall. Only reason we didn’t want to watch in the living area was because the couch was too small to lay on together. But overall the space of the unit was great and we loved it.

Elizabeth was very accommodating and we will reserve again!', 'The house was very accommodating as far as space goes. There was more than enough room to lounge around comfortably which I love to do. The house is older than it appeared in the photos which is not a bad thing, lots of character but unfortunately it had that old house smell that’s somewhat mildewy and took a while to get adjusted to. The beds are absolutely spectacular and we slept like babies although some blackout curtains would be a nice touch so we could sleep in a little more. The kitchen was generously equipped and the shower pressure was wonderful. The number one amenity was the location, close to any and everything you could need in Charlotte.', 'Very clean, with quality sheets and pillows.

This AirBnB fit the bill.\nI only had minor issues with the AirBnB experience:\n(1) It was hard to locate which house was the actual AirBnB because the house number either isn't there or is covered or something. We figured it out by locating the house numbers that were supposed to be around it.\n(2) I wish the house had regular baking trays. They had glass casserole dishes which took a long time to heat up and I think the oven is not super powerful either (which is generally not an issue, other than the fact that the two issues together make it extra long to cook things in the oven).\nMy experience with the host was positive. She was responsive and helpful. And if I realized earlier that I needed a baking tray or something, I'm sure she would have helped us out with it because she told me so in advance to reach out."", 'This is our second stay here, and I’m sure we’ll stay again while visiting the Charlotte area.

She communicated quickly and was responsive to our questions and needs."", 'Elizabeth was very flexible and kind when responding to request. The property is located in an aged neighborhood that is really quite and allows for quick access to restaurants and interstate. We found the bathroom to be really small. We found it difficult to rest as the home doesn’t appear secure. This concern comes from the front window street facing curtains don’t cover the entire window, also the front door has a large uncovered window that you can look straight into property. The additional doors are in need of repair or replacement as the handles still spin even when locked. The host delivered what was in the photo however, I would not recommend this for anyone wanting a modern touch.', 'Great location great place', 'Great location for quick drive to many areas.', 'Beautiful little home with lots of space that was perfect for my family.

We really felt at home for our stay.', 'The home itself looked very nice until I started getting settled and started noticing things. Even though we weren’t in the garage, one of the windows was broken, and with the overgrown vines and shrubs it just looked a little creepy. The rear of the house has a sticker labeled “protected by Radio Shack security” which shows how long it’s been since any updates have been made. The outside front door was also extremely difficult to close and lock.\nHaving said that, the bathroom and most of the rest of the house was very nice. The bathroom had clearly been updated recently, and I loved the shower pressure!\nOther parts of the house were unusual, in a “we don’t know what to do with this space” kind of way. For example, there was what appeared to be a hallway between the kitchen and bathroom area, but there was a loveseat opposite an antique curio with some black-and-white photos in it, maybe arm’s length across from where I sat. Not a bad thing by any means, I just found it unusual.', ""Elizabeth's cottage was the perfect stay for us.

I was even more pleasantly surprised to find a bottle of wine, a cheese board, and mini cheesecake bites. My favorite dessert and my favorite variety of cheese, so in addition to being a great host, Blythe is apparently also psychic lol.

Would come back.', 'Beautiful definitely enjoyed . I recommend please don’t second guess. BOOK WITH HIM NOW.', 'The apartment was conveniently located; however, it was next to a busy highway so it was loud. We were disappointed to find the place was insufficiently cleaned - chip crumbs on rug, used q-tip on floor outside bathroom, surfaces had not been dusted nor wiped down. When paying a $100 cleaning fee, I expected it to be clean and better maintained. Check-out instructions were lacking and after following the very minimal instructions, the host wanted to know where the fob was since it was not in the lockbox - no instructions to return the fob.

The proximity to our conference at North End was excellent & having parking included in the price is great!\nThe cons - A bit tricky to find the location of the lockboxes & when we did, had to stretch to open it. Not everyone is that tall! The unit & the building need a lot of maintenance. The elevators & the hallway carpets of the 4th floor were stained & dirty. Inside the unit, it looked clean at first glance, but a close look shows that much better attention needs to paid to deep, regular cleaning, improving the linens (towels, sheets/comforters, pillows, mattress pads all old and/or stained). The kitchen had some staples but was not really set up for cooking if that was planned. Also, in one cupboard I found several boxes of opened cereal - those should be removed. Also, the balcony which might be nice for enjoying a coffee or drink was dirty, full of leaves & host to a very dead plant.

If you want to walk the city this is a greater location. We walked to restaurants and the science center to see a movie. The apartment was clean and well stocked.

The walls were scuffed and dingy looking. The rugs and bedding were well worn. The bathtub had a very slow drain and rusty rod\n5. There was a strong odor in the room. The odor lingered all week. Everything we brought home had the smell in it including my CPAP. We recruited the help of Airbnb to help identify the smell since the host was being unresponsive.

Tv was nice.\nAll that aside, the air bnb had a few issues. First is that the bed is extremely uncomfortable, and has a huge lump in the middle, and either side is uneven. Sleeping here was difficult also due to noise outside, which they do say on the listing. Additionally, i noticed numerous stains on the walls behind the bed and under the counter which is pretty gross. They also don’t give you enough paper towels to do your own cleaning.

Little notes, instructions for light switches and appliances… a spice rack collection from previous guests, USB connections everywhere, smart TVs, lamps with remote controls, dimmers on almost every light switch… drawers everywhere… lots and lots of towels and bed linens in every closet… actually useful kitchen utensils… picture frames, color coordinated furniture…truly Mid Century modern. The details in this home make you want to extend your stay. It’s given me some amazing ideas for my own home.\nIt was a beautiful quiet and heart warming Christmas for us there.', '10/10 stay!

Loved the desk area where I was able to conduct a few online meetings.

It was near to the wedding venue so the location was great, it was clean and well decorated and the guest binder was detailed and helpful. Communication was quick and easy. Due to the hurricane we had hoped for a little flexibility in allowing us to bring our dogs last minute, but as “pets allowed” was not included in the listing we can’t hold that against them.\nSometimes houses are clearly half-***ed flips with strategic pictures, but this one gives what it shows.

We chose this place based on location as it is within walking distance of family, but we were surprised how clean, functional, and comfortable it was! The neighborhood has lovely trees and sidewalks and we felt safe walking in it. We stayed here with our young kids and it was perfect. Comfortable living space, great kitchen, very nice bathrooms, super comfy beds, great back deck with cafe lights. Parking and check in were super easy. We requested a pack and play before our arrival, and I’m pretty sure Erica and Brian went out and bought one for us! They were super friendly and responsive.

Living/lounge area smaller than expected from photos couch only accommodates 2. Missing items (kitchen/bath amenities) remedied quickly and offer to send cleaner was appreciated. Current construction next door not conducive to enjoying deck time during the day. Good value and cozy for a short stay thank you Brian and Erica!', 'I was misled by this listing. I believed I was getting the entire house, but upon arriving discovered there is a basement used as a separate airbnb. This made me feel very unsafe, as there is a door between the basement and the rest of the house. This is partly my fault, as there is one sentence at the bottom of the description that says this that I did not see. It is misleading, though, because the listing is ""Entire Rental Unit"" which Airbnb support has told me does not mean you have the entire house, just that there are not shared rooms with someone else. The photos are also misleading, as they are angled in such a way to obscure the existence of the basement.\nThere was excessive noise starting very early in the morning while I way staying there, as there is construction happening right next to the house.\nThere was hair all around the bathroom which makes me believe the place was not cleaned well.', 'Comfortable!', ""Property was beautiful.

Very charming !!!!', 'I would like to start that i did not think through how the place having carpet plus allowing animals would be to my allergies/senses since i have pets but no carpet so my review is based on my reaction to that. We had to have the host come by and clean the carpet on our 1st full day there because the smell was getting to my boyfriend and I but the smell was only in the living room/carpet area which kinda prevented us from enjoying the whole place. After he came by and cleaned tho it was much more manageable and he has said they would have carpet cleaners coming in after our stay so i do not believe that will be an issue again. Everything else was nice, good location close to stores and resturants. It is a little difficult to get in/out of the driveway since the road is busy and there will be car reving their engines at night but that was expected since we wanted to be close to things and not drive forever so it wasnt a major upset. Everything else is how it was advertised in pictures:)', 'Matthew was a great host. Always kick to respond with any questions or concerns. The place everything we needed.

Part of the checkout process was to strip the bed linens, the pillow were gross, TONS of yellow spots, they should be replaced ASAP\n3. The window A/C unit in the bedroom was old and very dirty, may have had mold in it\n4. There was a bit of an ant problem in the living room and kitchen\n5.

There are minimal items for cooking (condiments) but we didn’t need them since we had planned on eating out for the short stay anyway.

We chose Ken's place because we wanted a close & easy getaway for a few days. He's a very nice man, friendly, genuinely seems to like meeting new people. The reviews for the Zen Room were great, mostly about how friendly the animals were so we were looking forward to some cat & dog snuggles. What they didn't say was that you can't get close to the dogs without them jumping on you first. The reviews also didn't mention that we'd be woken up both nights (in the middle of the night) by Cheeto the cat trying to pry his way into our room. Not Zen. The full size bed (its absolutely not a queen) was really uncomfortable BUT the linens were super soft. It's a beautiful, safe neighborhood at a great price for a quick night's stay, but we didn't find it relaxing at all."", ""I had an amazing stay at Ken's place.

Great location easy to walk to places near by', '10/10', 'The unit was in a great building/ location and Jacques was great (extremely responsive and helpful), however the unit was not clean. The floor was sticky and visibly dirty, cups/mugs were dirty, and the sheets on the pull out bed and the pull out mattress itself were stained. When we raised these issues with Jacques he was understanding, apologetic, and worked with us to come up with a solution. I’m not sure I would stay here again due to the cleanliness, but other than that it was fine for a night.', ""It is a very nice apartment. However, there are two closets, both were locked only to be used by the cleaning service. This deficiency was not disclosed in the listing. There is only a picture of three hangers on the outside of a closet for an apartment that is supposed to sleep up to four people. Apparently, they decided to accommodate the cleaners instead of the guests. If that's what they want to do, you need to tell the guests that in the listing. The one set of drawers they provided was full of bedding that should have been in the closet. They apologized for the inconvenience several times, but I still had to store our clothes in other family members' closets on the other side of Charlotte. If you can live without closets, this is the place for you. For us, we need closet space."", 'I don’t like leaving bad reviews so all I’m going to say is I left an hour after check in because this place was not up to my cleanliness standards. That’s all. You can say I’m a slight germaphobe but at the end of the day I just didn’t feel comfortable staying here. The host was very responsive and did try to apologize for the situation. We ended up resolving the issue through a refund and I went to stay at a nearby hotel', 'Exactly as described. Hosts are very helpful and responsive! The detailed check in instructions were much appreciated. Highly recommend this stay in every way.', 'This was our second stay here, and it felt like coming home. The unit is clean and comfortable, with everything needed for a short stay.\nGreat location. Jacques responds quickly. Easy check-in.', 'It was excellent stay and exactly as described. Clean, quiet, and exactly what we were looking for.', 'Perfect location', 'Jacques was a great host! Very responsive! The place was easy to find, very convenient to everything. Literally less than 10 mins away from a lot! Place was very clean, bed was amazingly soft we didn’t want to get up lol. We enjoyed our stay and will definitely be booking again. Thank you', 'Great location, perfect communication, all around 5 Star accommodations.', 'Large studio in a new building, which is still partially under construction. A swimming pool is also present. The location is quite nice and pleasant; it is, however, lacking of a grocery store nearby (as far as I explored). Overall it has been a good experience.', 'Stayed for one night and it was the perfect rental for my stay. Check in and check out were easy. The apartment itself is great, felt like home. Jacques was very helpful and always responded quickly. I hope to return!', 'The host is very communicative and provides a step-by-step instruction guide before check-in, which made the apartment’s check-in and check-out process simple. The apartment is as described in the listing and the apartment complex itself is very quiet.\nI read in many of the reviews prior to my stay that the apartment was dirty upon checking in to which the host had responded to each review that it would be addressed. Therefore I was surprised that upon checking in the problem had not yet been addressed. Overall the apartment needs to be deep cleaned as the walls, baseboards, and kitchen island kick-board show visible marks, stains, and dirt. What should be a beige bedroom carpeting is dark brown. 90% of the dishes, pots/pans, bakeware, and utensils I pulled out of the cabinets were dirty and had to be washed before using. The previous guests towels and sheets were left in the dryer. All of this left me questioning if the apartment itself is appropriately cleaned between stays.', 'Great location, easy step by step instructions. Perfect spot for a great evening out. Thanks for opening up your spot for us!', 'Very clean apartment, uptown charlotte. Lots to do nearby. Looks exactly like photos. Its very easy to get access and right by building elevator', 'Jacques was a great host and the place was lovely.', 'Overall good. The cleanness can be improved. The floor was sticky and looked like it hasn’t been wiped at all.', 'Amazing !!

Jacques was a wonderful host, instructions were very clear and easy to follow.', 'Nice place with very organized and responsive hosts', 'Good accommodation in a great location, we felt very safe and we really liked the gym in the building. The communication with Jaques was great, the check-in process was easy to understand due to the good description. Would stay again!', 'Very nice well-equipped apartment, convenient location with parking close to downtown. Jacques was very responsive to all questions. Enjoyed our stay.', 'Great air bnb and the host was super helpful and organized!', 'The place was nice and clean. It is in a good location and walkable to many places we visited and enjoyed.\nHowever, upon entering the apartment we did not feel welcomed. The first thing we saw was a note stating that the police would be called if we smoked on the balcony in bold black letters. We had no problem adhering to this rule as we respect the rules and abide by them. We found this abhorrent and dishonest as it is not the role of policemen to enforce apartment rules such as smoking outside on a balcony.\nAlso, there were no instructions on the use of the TV, namely what apps the owners subscribed to.\nThese are our 2 main complaints.', 'Had a wonderful stay! 2 mins away from queen’s university so that was a major plus. We will definitely be back.', 'This is (I think) the 3rd time we have stayed at this property as my husband is receiving cancer care right across the street at Levine. This is very convenient for us.

Comfortable bed, kitchen outfitted well for my needs.', 'We enjoyed our stay at this airbnb. The host was very quick to respond and was very helpful when answering questions. The check in instructions are thorough and come with pictures that make them super easy to figure out. The place looked just as pictured. We had no issues at all.

Would definitely stay here again."", ""Enjoyed our stay. Don't let the check-in process deter you...once you find it and get it, it's a fun place in a good location."", 'Amazing stay! Jacques provided clear instructions on everything before arrival which really helped with the anxiety of planning a trip. The room was cozy and modern and had everything we needed, it even had a balcony. Would love to stay for longer as in this chance we could only stay for a night. The location is also 10/10. 100% recommended!', 'We had an amazing stay this weekend! Felt like home away from home!', 'A great stay!! The apartment was very clean and in a great location! The check in instructions were very clear and helpful.', 'Very clean place! Matches the pictures! Would definitely come here again!', 'Good instructions on how to get in. It was great to have secure indoor parking. The unit was comfortable to hang out in, but there is a nice community outdoor space just down the hall if you want a larger outdoor space than the small outdoor balcony space.', 'The place was just as described. It was in a safe area. The only amenity I took advantage of was the gym, and it was a great space. The instructions were very clear and the hosts were very responsive.', 'well taken area and apartment!!! beautiful city and great hosts.', 'Wonderful apartment not far from the heart of Charlotte, during a week long stay I only used 40 miles of gas because everything is so close.

We were just coming in to stay the night for a concert. The space was clean and looked just like the pictures. There were plenty of linens and towels. It was a little complicated to get in and the building is a bit confusing. But we felt super safe once inside! Would absolutely go back and recommend tobothers.', 'great location, great price, host was responsive, the front door lock is s little funky. overall great experience. would recommend to a friend.', 'This place was perfect while we received treatment at Levine Cancer Institute across the road. It was about a seven minute walk in total.\nWe loved our time here and felt right at home. It was clean and the pull out bed was surprisingly comfortable! Note: if you are staying here, there is only one trash bag available for your stay. The broom and dust pan is also locked up, so just be aware.\nMany thanks to this host for this convenient stay and amazing communication.']",['4 guests · 1 bedroom · 2 beds · 1 bath'],https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/40040746?adults=1&children=0&enable_m3_private_room=true&infants=0&pets=0&search_mode=regular_search&check_in=2024-10-28&check_out=2024-11-02&source_impression_id=p3_1729548940_P3VDg0n5jkGfZFVg&previous_page_section_name=1000&federated_search_id=950a4ccc-b9b7-41e2-9cc7-a2137827d2f5

Just big enough for four adults and one 15 lb dog. The furniture had a modern but classic feel and everything was comfy and soft. We are a tall bunch so the sofa was a little tight for two young adults and the range is 5’5 to 6’3’.\nWe broke in the kitchen and the backyard grill and had just enough dishes etc to grill wings, salmon, and sausages and enjoy bacon and eggs for breakfast. The neighbors nice and quiet even for the 4th! The neighbor gave us some vine ripe tomatoes which were tasty! Many restaurants and shopping within less than 10 minutes! Taco Boys, A Taste of Asia (late night del.), and Arigato (Hibachi Only) no sushi🤨\nDefinitely nice for adults and older people as it is one level.
